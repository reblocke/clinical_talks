# Proning for ARDS


## PROSEVA

### Protocol

Proned for at least 16 hours per day if: 

- P:F 150 or less with PEEP 10 or more and FiO2 60% or more after 12-24h period of stability 
- Head direction swapped every 2 hours
- Goal: Vt 6ml/kg, 7.2 - 7.45 pH, plat <30
- 87% received neuromuscular blockade. 

Continued until there was: 

- improvement above threshold for study inclusion
- deterioration in P:F of 20% or more relative to supine on 2 consecutive days
- mechanical or hemodynamic complication preventing proning
- 28 days.

## Other analyses

Retrospective analysis of intervention arm (n=225)

PaO2 responders (20% improvement) had similar outcomes to nonresponders
PaCO2 responders - drop in PaCO2 of 1 or more (mediated by a reduction in deadspace ventilation) had an improved survival - 35.1% vs 52.2%

This fits with Vd/Vt (deadspace fraction) being predictive of an increased risk of mortality in ARDS, even after adjusting for P:F ratio and PEEP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6363976/)


Changes in driving pressure seem like they ought to be even more predictive?
