# AKI in the ICU


## Estimating GFR

All commonly used equations for estimating GFR in the ICU are unacceptably precise and biased toward overestimating GFR. 

- muscle mass, age, gender, and race all effect concentration
- underfeeding, bedrest, and hyper catabolism would all be expected to change creatinine generation
- even beyond creatinine kinetics, fluid resuscitation would be expected to change creatinine by changing it's volume of distribution (same with muscle loss during a long hospitalization)
- steady state equations (e.g. C-G, CKD-EPI) assume stable sCr, which is often not the case in the ICU.
