# Fick Equation and PA Catheter Principles

- VO2 = amount of oxygen consumed. 
- CO = cardiac output
- Ca, Cv = content of O2 in the arterial circulation and venous circulation = (Hb * BO2 * % saturation) + (0.0032 * PaO2), where BO2 = the maximum amount of oxygen binding in a unit of blood, usually 1.39. 

VO2 = (CO * Ca) - (CO * Cv)

rearranged to

CO = VO2 / (Ca - Cv) 


## Direct Fick

Inspired O2 vs expired O2 measured (e.g. in a stress test) to calculate VO2. Then, you calculate the cardiac output

## Indirect Fick

Estimate CO by assuming a value for 1 of: VO2 (using a nomogram), CaO2 (using SpO2), or CvO2 (using EtCO2)

Practical usage: VO2 estimated with 125 ml / O2 * BSA

## Thermodilution

Principle: cardiac output = indicator dose * area under the time-concentration curve.

relies on uniform mixing and unidirectional flow. Margin of area ~25% with Fick. 

## Can you do this with a central venous catheter? 
Yes - with the Fick principle (to the extent that scvO2 approximates svO2... which is somewhat variable and contested - https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/cc9348). You need the mixing for thermodilution to be effective. 

# DO2

DO2 (Deliver of oxygen) and the DO2:VO2 ratio is particularly useful in differentiating types of shock.

# Pressures

## Central line

You can measure: 

- CVP ( R heart filling pressure )
- MAP ( pressure generated by the left heart) 

With cardiac output*, you can then calculate SVR

## PA Cathether

You can measure: 

- CVP (R heart filling pressure ) 
- MPAP ( pressure generated by the right heart )
- LVEDP (L heart filling pressure ) 
- MAP (pressure generated by the left heart)

With cardiac output, you can calculate SVR and PVR

## Comparison

Thus, with a central line, the heart & pulmonary vasculature is treated as a single unit (in a system with the systemic vasculature). With a PA catheter, you can resolve information about each of the 

# Vascular Resistance

Hydraulic version of Ohm's law

Voltage drop = I R  is rearranged to R = V / I


SVR:  (MAP-CVP)/CO

PVR: (PA_m - PCWP)/CO

In sum: times when PA catheter derived indices are particularly helpful: 

- R heart failure or pulmonary hypertension (thus limits traditional metrics of fluid responsiveness and assessment). Think: how do you differentiate R heart failure (low CO and high CVP) caused by elevated LVEDP, increased PA pressure, or decreased RV contractility? 
- times when TTE / Pulse contour analysis can't be used: AFib, IABP, or VAD
