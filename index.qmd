---

Welcome to **Clinical Talks**, a resident-facing collection of concise clinical topic outlines.
Content is intentionally lightweight while we port and curate the archive materials.

## What this is
Clinical Talks is a living set of short, high-yield talk pages meant to support bedside teaching,
pre-round review, and rapid refreshers for common inpatient topics. TODO: Expand the project overview.

## Intended audience
- Internal medicine residents and fellows.
- Subspecialty trainees looking for quick refreshers.
- TODO: Clarify broader audiences as needed.

## How to use this site
1. Pick a topic from the sidebar.
2. Scan the learning objectives and bottom line.
3. Review the approach and red flags before rounds.
4. TODO: Add guidance for contributing updates.
