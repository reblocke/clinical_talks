## What this covers
- Likelihood Ratios
- Application
- People with MRSA pneumonia: 9 test positive, 3 test negative

## Learning objectives
- Likelihood Ratios
- Application
- People with MRSA pneumonia: 9 test positive, 3 test negative
- People without MRSA pneumonia: 17 test positive, 71 test negative
- Sensitivity: 76.2% chance in somebody who does NOT have the disease (no MRSA PNa) that you get it right (says no MRSA)
- Specificity: 80.3% chance in somebody who has the disease that the test gets it right
- Positive predictive value: 35% chance in somebody who has a positive test that it gets it right

## Bottom line / summary
- ##VA dataset CID 2019 DOI: 2020;71(5):1142–8
- All patients 18+ screened with MRSA nasal swab at admission - 245,000 patients.
- Positive MRSA Nares in 22%.
- They looked at the subsequent likelihood of cultures being positive for various pathogens at various sites.
- Note: this does not establish true infection vs colonization: reference standard is just subsequent culture.

## Approach
1. People with MRSA pneumonia: 9 test positive, 3 test negative
2. People without MRSA pneumonia: 17 test positive, 71 test negative
3. Sensitivity: 76.2% chance in somebody who does NOT have the disease (no MRSA PNa) that you get it right (says no MRSA)
4. Specificity: 80.3% chance in somebody who has the disease that the test gets it right
5. Positive predictive value: 35% chance in somebody who has a positive test that it gets it right

## Red flags / when to escalate
- TODO: List red flags that require urgent escalation.

## Common pitfalls
- Model: 100ish people with pneumonia. 12 have MRSA PNa. 88 do not
- However, when practicing medicine - we don't know who has the disease vs not (that's the point of the workup). We just know the test result.
