## What this covers
- Dimorphic Fungal Infections
- Coccidiodes Imitis / Posadacii
- Histoplasma Capsulatum

## Learning objectives
- Dimorphic Fungal Infections
- Coccidiodes Imitis / Posadacii
- Histoplasma Capsulatum
- Blastomyces Dermitidis
- Paracoccidiodes Brasilensis
- Taloromyces (Penicillium)
- Aspergillus

## Bottom line / summary
- Mold form and yeast form
- mold cold (nature, 25-30c)
- Yeast in the beast (in organism, 37c)
- Endemic fungi natural habitat is limited to a given region
- Desert regions - classically in Arizona and San Joaquin valley, but does have outbreaks into southern utah

## Approach
1. Pneumonia is predominant (may have joint- 'desert rheumatism' and rash: erythema nodosum or multiform)
2. eosinophilia.
3. some day EIA for antigens may be more widely use
4. serology - cocci antibody panel (has all 3 of: ELISA, immunofixation/immunodiffusion, complement fixation which gives you a way to monitor response. ELISA has lots of false positivities, particularly with IgM - which is cross reactive)
5. culture (grows within 1 week) - reverts back to yeast form so can be infectious. very specific (no 'contaminants')

## Red flags / when to escalate
- TODO: List red flags that require urgent escalation.

## Common pitfalls
- TODO: Capture common errors or missed steps.
