## What this covers
- Do not renally adjust first dose of antibiotics (pharmacokinetics of first dose: concentration in blood is a result of volume of distribution. Elimination is only impactful on subsequent doses).
- Spiraling empiricism:
- Disease severity is not correlated with resistant organisms. Rationale for broad initial coverage assumes that more severe illness is not at higher risk of adverse effects.

## Learning objectives
- Do not renally adjust first dose of antibiotics (pharmacokinetics of first dose: concentration in blood is a result of volume of distribution. Elimination is only impactful on subsequent doses).
- Spiraling empiricism:

## Bottom line / summary
- Do not renally adjust first dose of antibiotics (pharmacokinetics of first dose: concentration in blood is a result of volume of distribution.
- Elimination is only impactful on subsequent doses).
- Spiraling empiricism:
- Disease severity is not correlated with resistant organisms.
- Rationale for broad initial coverage assumes that more severe illness is not at higher risk of adverse effects.

## Approach
1. Antibiotic Stewardship

## Red flags / when to escalate
- TODO: List red flags that require urgent escalation.

## Common pitfalls
- Do not renally adjust first dose of antibiotics (pharmacokinetics of first dose: concentration in blood is a result of volume of distribution. Elimination is only impactful on subsequent doses).

## References
TODO: Add landmark references or guideline citations.
