title: AKI In The ICU
draft: true

## What this covers
- Estimating GFR
- muscle mass, age, gender, and race all effect concentration
- underfeeding, bedrest, and hyper catabolism would all be expected to change creatinine generation

## Learning objectives
- Estimating GFR
- muscle mass, age, gender, and race all effect concentration
- underfeeding, bedrest, and hyper catabolism would all be expected to change creatinine generation
- even beyond creatinine kinetics, fluid resuscitation would be expected to change creatinine by changing it's volume of distribution (same with muscle loss during a long hospitalization)
- steady state equations (e.g. C-G, CKD-EPI) assume stable sCr, which is often not the case in the ICU.

## Bottom line / summary
- All commonly used equations for estimating GFR in the ICU are unacceptably precise and biased toward overestimating GFR.

## Approach
1. muscle mass, age, gender, and race all effect concentration
2. underfeeding, bedrest, and hyper catabolism would all be expected to change creatinine generation
3. even beyond creatinine kinetics, fluid resuscitation would be expected to change creatinine by changing it's volume of distribution (same with muscle loss during a long hospitalization)
4. steady state equations (e.g. C-G, CKD-EPI) assume stable sCr, which is often not the case in the ICU.
