## What this covers
- 30 - 60 mg of fixed acid is removed in kidney
- 14,000 mg of volatile acid is removed by the lungs
- Convective / Bulk-flow trasport: tidal movement of fluid (gas) through the airways and circular flow of fluid from the heart to the peripheral and back again.

## Learning objectives
- 30 - 60 mg of fixed acid is removed in kidney
- 14,000 mg of volatile acid is removed by the lungs
- Convective / Bulk-flow trasport: tidal movement of fluid (gas) through the airways and circular flow of fluid from the heart to the peripheral and back again.
- Diffusive transport: from alveoli in to blood, and from capillaries into tissues.
- Energy expenditure (kcal/d) [(VO2 3.941) + (VCO2 1.11) + (uN2 217) 1440.

## Bottom line / summary
- VO2 (aka metabolic rate) Qt (aka CO by fick) C(a-v)O2 (aka o2 extraction) S(a-v)O2 10 Hgb)
- Schematically: 2 types of transport enable respiration, which can be conceptualized as movement of O2 from ambient pO2 to low pO2 mitochondria (mitochondrial pO2 0.1-2 mmHg, but can't be clinically assessed)
- Director Calorimetry measure heat produced (via thermally sealed chamber)
- Indirect Calorimetry estimate heat produced by measuring O2 consumed and CO2 produced (because C6H12O6 + 6O2 -> 6CO2 + 6H2O + heat)
- UN2 urinary nitrogen component, often ignored b/c less than 4% of energy generally.

## Approach
1. 30 - 60 mg of fixed acid is removed in kidney
2. 14,000 mg of volatile acid is removed by the lungs
3. Convective / Bulk-flow trasport: tidal movement of fluid (gas) through the airways and circular flow of fluid from the heart to the peripheral and back again.
4. Diffusive transport: from alveoli in to blood, and from capillaries into tissues.
5. Energy expenditure (kcal/d) [(VO2 3.941) + (VCO2 1.11) + (uN2 217) 1440.

## Red flags / when to escalate
- TODO: List red flags that require urgent escalation.

## Common pitfalls
- Note: practical limitation - VO2 Vi(FiO2) - Ve(FeO2), but practically measuring FiO2 when over 60% predisposes to moer error so generally indirect calorimetry will be less acurate for Fio2 over 60% (or, of course, if FiO2 is changing)
