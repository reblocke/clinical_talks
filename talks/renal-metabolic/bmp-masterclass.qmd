## What this covers
- Sodium
- Potassium
- Chloride

## Learning objectives
- Sodium
- Potassium
- Chloride
- Bicarbonate
- BUN
- sCr
- Glucose

## Bottom line / summary
- You're a physician in the early days of medicine and you need to come up with 7 tests to interrogate renal function...
- How did medicine arrive at the tests we did?
- When is this misleading?
- Is Saline Nephrotoxic?
- Does a high or low bicarbonate indicate that there must be a metabolic alkalosis or acidosis present?

## Approach
1. rebuild an understanding of electrolyte balance from the clinical application to the scientific / physiology (as opposed vice versa)
2. generate a better understanding of the gaps of our routine labs in assessment of the body's ability to maintain homeostasis
3. surrogate for osmolality / tonicity of the serum.
4. of course this goes wrong if there is another major source of osmolality, such as alcohol / glucose / contrast
5. important in the functioning of nerve cells (particularly the resting membrane potential)

## Red flags / when to escalate
