## What this covers
- Hyponatremia
- DDAVP Clamp
- Free water Clearance

## Learning objectives
- Hyponatremia
- DDAVP Clamp
- Free water Clearance
- Hypernatremia

## Bottom line / summary
- What is the difference between osmolality and tonicity?
- What's an example of where they might differ?
- Osmolality measure of number of particles in a solution.
- Tonicity measure of pull across a membrane.
- Urea, for example, easily passes through the cell membrane and thus contributes to osmolality but not tonicity.

## Approach
1. Electrolytes
2. Hyponatremia
3. DDAVP Clamp

## Red flags / when to escalate
- TODO: List red flags that require urgent escalation.

## Common pitfalls
- DDAVP (ADH) is given back to stop this (to avoid overcorrection) by impeding the bodies ability to excrete water.
