## What this covers
- increases inspiratory effort (static load), reduces lung capacity (static load), shifts blood from lower body into chest (abd organs, for instance, are less dense than H2O - induces diuresis as sensed as fluid overload. Preload increased), and induces autonomic reflexes.
- the decreased ambient/barometric pressure means that a PaO2 concentration drops, causing a dip in PaO2
- Remaining air in the lungs increases intrathoracic pressure (atelectasis resolves) and leads to decreased preload.

## Learning objectives
- increases inspiratory effort (static load), reduces lung capacity (static load), shifts blood from lower body into chest (abd organs, for instance, are less dense than H2O - induces diuresis as sensed as fluid overload. Preload increased), and induces autonomic reflexes.
- the decreased ambient/barometric pressure means that a PaO2 concentration drops, causing a dip in PaO2
- Remaining air in the lungs increases intrathoracic pressure (atelectasis resolves) and leads to decreased preload.
- PaO2 < 30 leads to LOC (to 20 with training - increase cerebral blood flow to adapt)
- The normal rise in PaCO2 is 3 to 4 mmHg min−1.
- on room air, typically near 50 mmHg (diaphragmatic contractions occur at PaCO2 ~46-49)
- on supplemental oxygen, can tolerate much longer (highly trained apneass can increase their conventional breakpoint to critical hypoxia, which is 20-30 mmHg O2)

## Bottom line / summary
- Immersion: body surrounded by water; exposed to external hydrostatic pressure.
- In terms of lung volumes, immersion to the neck -28 cmH2O of pressure due to the water column on the chest.
- Maximal inspiratory pressure that the chest/diaphragm can generate is 100-150 cmH2O, which corresponds to the longest tube you could theoretically breath through, even if it was large enough that flow resistance was negligible.
- -- you also get additive transmural pressures across the heart chambers, due to pressure of increased preload from hydrostatic pressure on body)
- Normally, spleen holds/sequesters 10% of blood volume.

## Approach
1. increases inspiratory effort (static load), reduces lung capacity (static load), shifts blood from lower body into chest (abd organs, for instance, are less dense than H2O - induces diuresis as sensed as fluid overload. Preload increased), and induces autonomic reflexes.
2. the decreased ambient/barometric pressure means that a PaO2 concentration drops, causing a dip in PaO2
3. Remaining air in the lungs increases intrathoracic pressure (atelectasis resolves) and leads to decreased preload.
4. PaO2 < 30 leads to LOC (to 20 with training - increase cerebral blood flow to adapt)
5. The normal rise in PaCO2 is 3 to 4 mmHg min−1.
