## What this covers
- Bubble volume reduction
- Increased blood/tissue PO2
- Gas washout

## Learning objectives
- Bubble volume reduction
- Increased blood/tissue PO2
- Gas washout
- Vasoconstriction (in some vascular beds)
- Neovascularization (use cases: OM, chronic wounds, post-radiation)
- Increased WBC oxidative killing -> particularly useful for nectoxins from clostridium / anaerobes + toxins
- modulation of ischemia/reperfusion

## Bottom line / summary
- 60 or so centers in US that are able to do critical care hyperbaric medicine.
- (800-900 centers can do hyperbaric wound care)
- Definition: anything greater than 1 atm (sea level) of pressure.
- For billing purposes, greater than 1.4 atm of 100% oxygen (98+%)
- Monoplace chamber 1 person (3h runs); Multiplace chamber multiple people, delivered by mask.

## Approach
1. Bubble volume reduction
2. Increased blood/tissue PO2
3. Gas washout
4. Vasoconstriction (in some vascular beds)
5. Neovascularization (use cases: OM, chronic wounds, post-radiation)
