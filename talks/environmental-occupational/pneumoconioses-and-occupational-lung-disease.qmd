draft: true
---

## What this covers
- Occupational lung disease: includes
- Pneumoconioses
- Example associations:

## Learning objectives
- Occupational lung disease: includes
- Pneumoconioses
- Example associations:
- Radiographic findings:
- Silicosis
- Coal Worker's Pneumoconiosis
- Asbestos

## Bottom line / summary
- Occupational lung disease criteria
- disease resulting from inhaling inorganic particles that cause a reaction in the lung.
- Asbestosis: shipyard workers, auto/railroad mechanics, asbestos miners
- Silicosis: mining, construction (tunneling, sand blasting, concrete work), glass manufacturing, ceramics, foundries, denim sanblasting
- Coal worker's pneumonitis: coal mining

## Approach
1. pneumoconioses
2. HP
3. bronchiolitis
4. occupational asthma
5. (occupational pulmonary vascular disease)

## Red flags / when to escalate
- TODO: List red flags that require urgent escalation.

## Common pitfalls
- TODO: Capture common errors or missed steps.

## References
TODO: Add landmark references or guideline citations.
