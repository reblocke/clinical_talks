## What this covers
- Massive PE:
- Advanced therapies
- Systemic TPA

## Learning objectives
- Massive PE:
- Advanced therapies
- Systemic TPA
- Catheter treatments
- Surgical Embolectomy
- VA ECMO
- IVC Filter

## Bottom line / summary
- Considerations around initial anticoagulant and monitoring : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4715843/
- If a patient receives catheter directed lytics: give heparin on top?
- Yes, probably - though there has not been a clear trial of how to do this.
- IMC - follows European cardiology guidelines: https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/4/543/5556136
- Intermediate-High risk: (Not shock but signs of RH strain based on CT, TTE, or Troponin) AC only and monitoring.

## Approach
1. need at least some to prevent clot on the sheath
2. probably need more, but not clear if you need treatment dose, intermediate dose, or just low dose. Ask pharm and interventionalists.
3. History of haemorrhagic stroke or stroke of unknown origin
4. Ischaemic stroke in previous 6 months
5. Central nervous system neoplasm

## Red flags / when to escalate
- Intermediate-High risk: (Not shock but signs of RH strain based on CT, TTE, or Troponin) AC only and monitoring. Generally only do advanced therapies if they have deranged vital signs (tacky 140+, 100% HFNC, no improvement with heparin and you think it's this). Then, do low dose systemic TPA (alteplase 10mg boluses up to 50mg) a la MOPETT if they are low bleed risk (e.g. Age <65), or mechanical thrombectomy (if age over 65 or contra to TPA).
- High risk shock with PE, sustained for 15 minutes or requiring pressers for that duration: systemic thrombolysis or catheter thrombolysis. Other options are US-assisted thrombus fragmentation, Suction embolectomy, or mechanical thrombectomy, Surgical embolectomy, VA ECMO.
- 8 person 1995 RCT is the best evidence (basically no evidence). Meta-analyses only including patients with shock OR death 0.59. In Intermediate-High risk, mortality estimate is OR 1.09.
- MOPETT: AJC 2013. "Safe Dose" tPA - enrolled 121 patients with large thrombus burden, VS abnormalities but not shock. Alteplase 50mg total (10mg up front, then 40mg), received uninterrupted anticoagulation with maximal rate. But no bleeding.
- Means of supportive care for refractory obstructive shock. Often, combine with another modality (e.g. thrombectomy.

## Common pitfalls
- Thus, generally use Warfarin. (even for non-triple positive, because we don't exactly know why)
- Cardiolipin ab (IgG and IgM - do NOT test for IgA, not correlated)
- betaglycoprotein (IgG and IgM - do NOT test for IgA, not correlated)
- most commonly AT3 deficiency ( normally functions at a low level as the body's natural anticoagulant): can be consumptive (e.g. DIC, long-term heparin use, bypass/ECMO) or production problem (e.g. liver failure). -> can give FFP or antithrombin concentrate (mostly in OR by anesthesiology in cardiac surgery). Beware of rebound once the AT3 comes back up if consumptive process is removed.
- PEITHO study, NEJM 2014 in intermediate-risk PE using tenecteplase (available in Europe, not here), equivalent to full dose of alteplase (60-100mg) and did not interrupt heparin. Benefit in preventing hemodynamic compensation or rescue thrombolysis. Risk of intracranial and major extra cranial bleeding. Per 100 patients: prevent decomposition in 3, 2 hemorrhagic strokes, 5 major extra cranial bleeding. > sum, do not give.
