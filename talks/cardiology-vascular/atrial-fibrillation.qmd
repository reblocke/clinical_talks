## What this covers
- Magnesium 1-3g over 10 minutes, repeat if no response in 15 minutes. Combined critical and noncritical illness AF with RVR: 21.4% have resolution of RVR. (Ho KM, Sheridan DJ, Paterson T. Use of intravenous magnesium to

## Learning objectives
- Magnesium 1-3g over 10 minutes, repeat if no response in 15 minutes. Combined critical and noncritical illness AF with RVR: 21.4% have resolution of RVR. (Ho KM, Sheridan DJ, Paterson T. Use of intravenous magnesium to
- Amiodarone
- In the ICU:
- Pathogenesis: 1. Arrythmogenic substrate and 2. trigger (e.g. electrolytes, PANS/SANS activation). Without the arrythmogenic substrate, the rhythm is short-lived.
- Impact: 25% rate is over 150. 12.5% have signs of ischemia.
- Possible algorithm from CHEST review (https://journal.chestnet.org/action/showPdf?piiS0012-3692%2818%2930545-2)
