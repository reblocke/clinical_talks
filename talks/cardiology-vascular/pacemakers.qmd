## What this covers
- self contained generator and electrode that is implanted into the right ventricle for single chamber pacing.
- benefit: no pocket infections, pacer wires, no incision (implanted via femoral vein), MRI compatible
- down side: 1 chamber, can't defibrillate

## Learning objectives
- self contained generator and electrode that is implanted into the right ventricle for single chamber pacing.
- benefit: no pocket infections, pacer wires, no incision (implanted via femoral vein), MRI compatible
- down side: 1 chamber, can't defibrillate

## Bottom line / summary
- ###Leadless pacemaker
- (Citation: The leadless pacemaker: An innovative design to enhance pacemaking capabilities.
- JAAPA 2019;32:48-50.)
- self contained generator and electrode that is implanted into the right ventricle for single chamber pacing.
- benefit: no pocket infections, pacer wires, no incision (implanted via femoral vein), MRI compatible

## Approach
1. self contained generator and electrode that is implanted into the right ventricle for single chamber pacing.
2. benefit: no pocket infections, pacer wires, no incision (implanted via femoral vein), MRI compatible
3. down side: 1 chamber, can't defibrillate
