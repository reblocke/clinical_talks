## What this covers
- Bronchoalveolar lavage for pneumonia in immunocompromised patients
- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31541573/ In hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients - discordant results occurred in 42 of 115 paired upper and lower respiratory viral multiplex samples. 17 of the 42 were positive in LRT but negative in URT.
- Adenovirus, Human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza were discordant. RSV was concordant.

- "FOB with BAL can be completed in severely thrombocytopenic patients with a minimally increased risk of bleeding, and thrombocytopenia should not be considered a contraindication to performing this procedure [5]. There are no data to suggest that FOB with BAL has a higher risk of bleeding in coagulopathic patients or in those receiving anticoagulation, and these conditions should not preclude the procedure being performed [6].
- The incidence of severe complications during bronchoscopy is 0.637%
- A differential count with greater than 50% neutrophils may be indicative of acute lung injury or bacterial infection, whereas BAL lymphocytosis suggests granulomatous lung disease, viral infection, or interstitial lung disease [8].
