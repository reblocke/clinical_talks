## What this covers
- Physics
- Artifacts
- Doppler

## Learning objectives
- Physics
- Artifacts
- Doppler
- Normal Anatomy
- Flows
- LV Outflow
- RV Outflow

## Bottom line / summary
- Parameters controlled by settings on the machine
- In addition to these settings, there are post processing and preprocessing settings to adjust the display.
- Intercept angle angle between US beam and direction of travel.
- Cos(theta) amount understimate
- PRF pulse <what?> frequency - determines maximum velocity (get nyquist effect if things are moving faster signal aliasing)

## Approach
1. power output (higher higher amplitude reflected signals. Limited by safety. Bone heats faster than fat)
2. gain (displayed amplitude of received signals, analogous to turning up the volume)
3. Time-gain compensation (differential adjustment of gain along length of ultrasound beam; allows for correction of loss to attenuation in certain tissues)
4. Depth (how long the machine waits before sending the next signal; increase depth decreases frame rate and maximal display area)
5. Dynamic range and compression (amplitude range; larger dynamic range more shades of grey)
