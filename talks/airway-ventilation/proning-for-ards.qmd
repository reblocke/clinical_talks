## What this covers
- PROSEVA
- Protocol
- Other analyses

## Learning objectives
- PROSEVA
- Protocol
- Other analyses

## Bottom line / summary
- Proned for at least 16 hours per day if:
- Continued until there was:
- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14668608/
- Retrospective analysis of intervention arm (n225)
- PaO2 responders (20% improvement) had similar outcomes to nonresponders PaCO2 responders - drop in PaCO2 of 1 or more (mediated by a reduction in deadspace ventilation) had an improved survival - 35.1% vs 52.2%

## Approach
1. P:F 150 or less with PEEP 10 or more and FiO2 60% or more after 12-24h period of stability
2. Head direction swapped every 2 hours
3. Goal: Vt 6ml/kg, 7.2 - 7.45 pH, plat <30
4. 87% received neuromuscular blockade.
5. improvement above threshold for study inclusion

## Red flags / when to escalate
- TODO: List red flags that require urgent escalation.

## Common pitfalls
- TODO: Capture common errors or missed steps.
