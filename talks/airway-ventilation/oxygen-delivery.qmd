## What this covers
- Consider how is it possible to be hypoxic without being hypoxemic? How is it possible to be hypoxemic without being hypoxic
- ￼￼￼
- Hypoxic without hypoxemic Therefore ways you can be hypoxic: Hypoxemia, low cardiac output, anemia, or cytopathy (Something interfering with the ability of the cells to undergo oxidative phosphorylation, examples being cyanide poisoning, salicylates, septic shock)￼￼

## Learning objectives
- Consider how is it possible to be hypoxic without being hypoxemic? How is it possible to be hypoxemic without being hypoxic

- Hypoxic without hypoxemic Therefore ways you can be hypoxic: Hypoxemia, low cardiac output, anemia, or cytopathy (Something interfering with the ability of the cells to undergo oxidative phosphorylation, examples being cyanide poisoning, salicylates, septic shock)￼￼
- Hypoxemic without hypoxia Increasing cardiac output￼￼

## Bottom line / summary

## Approach
1. oxygen delivery

## Red flags / when to escalate
- Hypoxic without hypoxemic Therefore ways you can be hypoxic: Hypoxemia, low cardiac output, anemia, or cytopathy (Something interfering with the ability of the cells to undergo oxidative phosphorylation, examples being cyanide poisoning, salicylates, septic shock)￼￼
