## What this covers
- ##Ventilatory Failure
- Work of breathing
- Not synonymous with respiratory rate

## Learning objectives
- ##Ventilatory Failure
- Work of breathing
- Not synonymous with respiratory rate
- Phasic contraction of sternocleinomastoid is most sensitive exam maneuver.
- Think about the effect of deadspace (Vd/Vt) - increase will lead to an increased minute ventilation required to maintain a given pCO2.
- Consider requirements (not necessarily hypercarbic, e.g. in DKA)
- Why do we get short of breath in pneumonia? TODO
