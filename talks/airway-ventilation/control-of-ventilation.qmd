## What this covers
- Analogy to Creatinine Clearance
- Hypoventilation
- Exercise

## Learning objectives
- Analogy to Creatinine Clearance
- Hypoventilation
- Exercise
- Changes In CHF:
- Mechanisms of hypercapnia (or under ventilation for demand)
- Acute Decompensation of OHS
- Oxygen in SDB

## Bottom line / summary
- Source: DOI: 10.1183/09031936.00048514
- [ ] Deranged physiology slides?
- Application: Bilateral denervation of the carotid bodies leads to ABSENCE of hypoxemia drive to breath AND blunting of H+ response to breathe.
- (Dahan A, Nieuwenhuijs D, Teppema L.
- Plasticity of central chemoreceptors: effect of bilateral carotid body resection on central CO2 sensitivity.

## Approach
1. central medullary rhythm/pattern generator and integrator (brainstem) - primarily in the pre-Botzinger complex and pontine raphe. Bilateral (thus, not destroyed by acute ischemic stroke in the absence of catastrophe)
2. Sensory inputs Chemoreceptors - carotid body (peripheral - sense a variety of stimuli such as O2 levels) and medulla (central - H+, linear increase in VA to increase in H+ in CSF - whose changes are moderate by active H+ transport at the BBB). Stimulation of the peripheral chemoreceptors increases the slope of the central H+ receptors (meaning, a given increase in H+ will result in a larger increase in ventilation). Note: carotid BODY (chemoreceptor) / carotid sinuses (baroreceptors, blood pressure)
3. precise synchronous distribution of motor output to the respiratory musculature of the upper airway as well as the chest and abdominal walls (via C3-4-5, phrenic keeps the diaphragm alive).
4. Anticipatory, feed forward mechanism: allows increase in VA to occur prior to drop in pH (increase in CO2).
5. Muscles provide feedback (blocking muscle afferents with curare lowers Va similar to drop from intrathecal fentanyl - interestingly this blockage can improve exercise performance in those with COPD)

## Red flags / when to escalate
- Or at the time of escalation outpatient care to a pulmonologist or sleep medicine physician
- Can be related to unstable breathing caused by high loop gain or decrease central neuron output (e.g. narcotics, one of the few circumstances this occurs - 'ataxic breathing'. This is separate from the decreased response to hypercapnia caused by opiates).
- Treatment emergent and persistent CSA: Post-hyperventilation apnea? Revisit pathology here
- do not use the diagnosis of treatment-emergent CSA for CSA in patients with underlying cardiovascular, endocrine, renal or neurological diseases, or for pre-existing CSA prior to initiation of PAP and transient CSA

## Common pitfalls
- Carotid body doesn't increase VA slope in response to hypoxemia unitl PaO2 <55-60 mmHg. Consequence (and question): anemia, CO inhalation do NOT cause hyperventilation.
- do not use the diagnosis of treatment-emergent CSA for CSA in patients with underlying cardiovascular, endocrine, renal or neurological diseases, or for pre-existing CSA prior to initiation of PAP and transient CSA
