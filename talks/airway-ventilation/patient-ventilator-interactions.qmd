## What this covers
- What to do if we can’t get a plat?
- Dyssynchrony types:
- Patterns on the ventilator

## Learning objectives
- What to do if we can’t get a plat?
- Dyssynchrony types:
- Patterns on the ventilator

## Bottom line / summary
- https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.09316
- The mathematical model describing this is the Equation of Motion for the Respiratory System.
- There are many forms of this equation, but a simple version is expressed as:
- Pmus + Pvent EV + R V (1)
- where Pvent is the inspiratory pressure generated by the ventilator (above PEEP), Pmus is the inspiratory pressure generated by the respiratory muscles, E is elastance (cm H2O/mL), V is volume (mL), R is resistance (cm H20/L/s), and V is flow (L/min), all measured relative to their end-expiratory values

## Approach
