title: Ventilatory Failure
draft: true

## What this covers
- Workup
- Reasons for an increased Minute Ventilation Requirement
- Reasons for a decreased Maximal Sustainable Minute Ventilation

## Learning objectives
- Workup
- Reasons for an increased Minute Ventilation Requirement
- Reasons for a decreased Maximal Sustainable Minute Ventilation
- Work of breathing
- Respiratory Drive

## Bottom line / summary
- Consider, how is it possible to have ventilatory respiratory failure without a high CO2
- Increased carbon dioxide production.
- An example would be someone that's in DKA and thus is in a profound metabolic acidosis.
- They are unable to compensate for this metabolic acidosis by increasing their minute ventilation to a sufficient degree, and this may be unable to maintain their ventilatory requirement despite a Low CO2
- Think of this as a in versus out problem.￼￼￼

## Approach
1. RR > determine won't breath (opiates, give narcan. Obesity/a on c respiratory failure) vs can't breath
2. pH (or by Henderson Hasselbach - bicarbonate) > determines the chronicity of the abnormality by the presence or absence of metabolic compensation.
3. The +1 is mental status, because that will influence how you can treat the situation of "Acute Can't Breath"
4. Increased VPCO2
5. Increased VD/VT
