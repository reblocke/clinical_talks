## What this covers
- Starling Resistors
- Convective Acceleration
- Ohmic Resistors / Ohms Law

## Learning objectives
- Starling Resistors
- Convective Acceleration
- Ohmic Resistors / Ohms Law

## Bottom line / summary
- Gases and Liquids are both fluids.
- Pressure Force / Area (Force x Distance) / (Area x Distance) Work / Volume Energy / Volume Energy Density.
- Fluids move from high pressure aka energy density to low pressure aka energy density.
- Gauge pressure referenced to atmospheric pressure.
- Pressure transducer deformable membrane between two fluids - deformation indicated difference in pressure.

## Approach
1. Pulmonary Mechanics
2. Starling Resistors
3. Convective Acceleration

## Red flags / when to escalate
- TODO: List red flags that require urgent escalation.

## Common pitfalls
- TODO: Capture common errors or missed steps.
