## What this covers
- Hypoventilation
- Reduced Mixed Venous O2
- Other, less common clinically

## Learning objectives
- Hypoventilation
- Reduced Mixed Venous O2
- Other, less common clinically
- Diffusion limitation across the blood:gas barrier at alveoli
- Reduced PiO2
- Ways to quantify oxygenation efficiency

## Bottom line / summary
- ##History Research started to explain why WW2 pilots crashed at high altitude.
- Initially thought it was CO poisoning.
- Rley and Cournand J Appl Physiol 1949
- How this physiology was discovered: MIGET (Multiple Inert Gas Elimination Technique): 6 different gasses varying in solubility.
- Don't react with body inert.

## Approach
1. Highly Soluble (Acetone) differentiates high V/Q from deadspace.
2. Poorly Soluble (sulfur hexafluoride) differentiates low V/Q from shunt
3. SpO2: peripheral estimate of SaO2
4. PaO2 chemical activity of O2
5. CaO2 ml O2 per dL of blood (depends on Hgb)

## Red flags / when to escalate
- TODO: List red flags that require urgent escalation.

## Common pitfalls
- P (A-a) O2 (conceptually important, but always elevated if on supplemental O2. Additionally, deviations of R from 0.8 will introduce error)
- How this physiology was discovered: MIGET (Multiple Inert Gas Elimination Technique): 6 different gasses varying in solubility. Don't react with body inert. Obey Henry's law
