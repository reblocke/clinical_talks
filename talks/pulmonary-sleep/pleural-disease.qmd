- When snorkeling under water using their trunk, the pressure in the abdomen, vessels (including inside the pleura), and outside of thorax are at increase pressure due to the column of water (150 mmHg ish).
- Pressure in the air space is 0 (column of air is minuscule).
- Would lead to very large pressure gradient inside pleura pneumothorax, vessel rupture (hemothorax), or huge transudate from starling forces.

## Approach
1. generally, pleural pressure is below atmosphere.
2. water seal 1 way valve where fluid (gas or liquid) will flow if a small pressure is overcome (e.g. 2 cmh2o)
3. Answer: yes - because the valve is 1-way, if the pressure in the pleural space is ever 2 cm-H2O or more above atmospheric pressure, it will burp some air out and the lung will re-expand a bit. This will continue until the lung is expanded (or, if the lung is entrapped or trapped) the intra-pleural pressure decreases such that it never reaches more than 2 above atmospheric. This occurs even though the intrapleural pressure is usually below atmospheric. This would be accelerated by having the patient cough or forced exhalation (increases intrathoracic pressure).
4. probably a result of injury to the lung from transplueral pressure: think of this as analagous to VILI - instead of a high driving pressure via the positive pressure ventilator, it is a higher (more local) driving pressure as a result from lower pressure in the pleural space driving lung expansion.
5. thus, it's reasonable to keep taking fluid as long as the intrapleural pressure is not dropping significantly below atmospheric.

## Red flags / when to escalate
- TODO: List red flags that require urgent escalation.

## Common pitfalls
- Light's Criteria: calibrated to prioritize sensitivity to exudates (bigger consequence if missed) over specificity due to greater harm in missing.
