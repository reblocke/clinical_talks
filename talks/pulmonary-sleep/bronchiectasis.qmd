## What this covers
- Presentation: think of nonsmoker with COPD, hemoptysis
- NOTE: MAC (some debate if it's a chicken or egg came first)
- Unknown why it's uncommon in patients who are obese

## Learning objectives
- Presentation: think of nonsmoker with COPD, hemoptysis
- NOTE: MAC (some debate if it's a chicken or egg came first)
- Unknown why it's uncommon in patients who are obese
- CT Diagnosis: [ ] criteria? Airway > vessel. Should be 1.5x to make clear dx.
- In addition to the radiographic findings, to have the clinical syndrome they should have symptoms attributable to it
- Fundamentally, mucus is good and is antimicrobial properties secretions. However mucus plus bacteria equals sputum, which if persistent does indicate a problem.
- More than two anabiotic prescriptions for respiratory infections within six months, or airflow obstruction in a non-smoker should both prompt evaluation for bronchiectasis with CT scan￼￼￼

## Bottom line / summary
- Presentation: think of nonsmoker with COPD, hemoptysis
- NOTE: MAC (some debate if it's a chicken or egg came first)
- Unknown why it's uncommon in patients who are obese
- CT Diagnosis: [ ] criteria?
- Should be 1.5x to make clear dx.

## Approach
1. Bronchiectasis

## Red flags / when to escalate
- TODO: List red flags that require urgent escalation.

## Common pitfalls
- If MAC excluded (to avoid monotherapy), can use chronic azithromycin.

## References
TODO: Add landmark references or guideline citations.
