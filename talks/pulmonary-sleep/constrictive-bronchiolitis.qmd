## Learning objectives
- Pathology
- Presentation
- Workup

## Bottom line / summary
- https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1101388
- Membranous bronchioles develop mural smooth muscle hypertrophy or fibrous thickening with luminal narrowing.
- Non-specific respiratory symptoms and exercise limitation
- Imaging: shows air trapping on expiratory films in about 1/4.
- However, normal imaging findings occur in the majority due to the absence of alveolar disease

## Approach
1. Burn pit exposures / Iraq service
2. inhalation exposure to: Nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, inorganic dust, fly ash, and diacetyl (popcorn)
3. Post-transplant
4. Rheumatologic conditions

## Red flags / when to escalate
- TODO: List red flags that require urgent escalation.

## Common pitfalls
- TODO: Capture common errors or missed steps.
