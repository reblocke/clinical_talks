## What this covers
- PAH: PVR over 3.0, PCWP under 15. iPAH (idiopathic), aPAH (associated: SSC, HIV, asd/vsd, etc), hPAH (heritable)
- L Heart: PCWP over 15. Echo hints - large atria, diastolic dysfxn
- Lung dz: co-occuring with ILD, COPD, OSA/OHS, etc.

## Learning objectives
- PAH: PVR over 3.0, PCWP under 15. iPAH (idiopathic), aPAH (associated: SSC, HIV, asd/vsd, etc), hPAH (heritable)
- L Heart: PCWP over 15. Echo hints - large atria, diastolic dysfxn
- Lung dz: co-occuring with ILD, COPD, OSA/OHS, etc.
- CTEPH
- Grab bag that we don't understand (e.g. sarcoid)
- NO (Nitric Oxide) - all oral - viagra, riocigual.
- Endothelin - all oral - macitentan, ambrisentan

## Bottom line / summary
- PVR (mPAP - PCWP) / CO.
- mPAP (PVR CO) + PCWP < increase each leads to mPAP (exercise, anemia for CO)
- Definition: pHTN 21+ mmHg
- "pHTN by echo" to avoid implication that a formal workup has been done to split into a WHO group.
- ####Shunt Left to right: R Heart cath can be used to measure oxygen step up between chambers (if more than 7-8% increase, signficant)

## Approach
1. PAH: PVR over 3.0, PCWP under 15. iPAH (idiopathic), aPAH (associated: SSC, HIV, asd/vsd, etc), hPAH (heritable)
2. L Heart: PCWP over 15. Echo hints - large atria, diastolic dysfxn
3. Lung dz: co-occuring with ILD, COPD, OSA/OHS, etc.
4. CTEPH
5. Grab bag that we don't understand (e.g. sarcoid)

## Red flags / when to escalate
- TODO: List red flags that require urgent escalation.

## Common pitfalls
- Grab bag that we don't understand (e.g. sarcoid)
- "pHTN by echo" to avoid implication that a formal workup has been done to split into a WHO group.

TODO: Add landmark references or guideline citations.
