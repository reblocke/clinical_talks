## What this covers
- Antigen removal (worse prognosis if no antigen is identified - Noguieria et al Pulmonology 2019)
- Steroids, but weak evidence base (RCT of 36 resulted in improvement in DLCo and FVC at 1 month but no difference at 5 years; matched cohort of 144 showed slower fibrosis progression on CT - esp early fibrosis)
- AZA, MMF - need to exclude IPF (increased mortality). Less side effects than long-term steroids.

## Learning objectives
- Antigen removal (worse prognosis if no antigen is identified - Noguieria et al Pulmonology 2019)
- Steroids, but weak evidence base (RCT of 36 resulted in improvement in DLCo and FVC at 1 month but no difference at 5 years; matched cohort of 144 showed slower fibrosis progression on CT - esp early fibrosis)
- AZA, MMF - need to exclude IPF (increased mortality). Less side effects than long-term steroids.
- ? Nintedanib - INBUILD study, progressive fibrosis including 26.1% who had chronic HP

## Bottom line / summary
- Extrinsic allergic alveolitis - to inhaled organic small particles.

## Approach
1. Antigen removal (worse prognosis if no antigen is identified - Noguieria et al Pulmonology 2019)
2. Steroids, but weak evidence base (RCT of 36 resulted in improvement in DLCo and FVC at 1 month but no difference at 5 years; matched cohort of 144 showed slower fibrosis progression on CT - esp early fibrosis)
3. AZA, MMF - need to exclude IPF (increased mortality). Less side effects than long-term steroids.
4. ? Nintedanib - INBUILD study, progressive fibrosis including 26.1% who had chronic HP
