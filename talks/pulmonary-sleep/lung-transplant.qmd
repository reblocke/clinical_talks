## Learning objectives
- Indications
- Contraindicatoins
- Complications
- Rejection

## Bottom line / summary
- 3 cell model targets for immunosuppression
- Primarily targetted toward T-cells
- Cause nephrotoxicity by increasing afferent tone and magnesium wasting (as well as potassium elevation), metallic taste, and DM
- Serologies (IgG Viremia donoor and recipient); most adults EBV+, CMV+.
- Dz shows up as malaise.

## Approach
1. Class 1 vs nucleated cells
2. Class 2 vs all cells
3. APCs -> T-lymphs
4. Induction as it happens (in surgery). Goal reduce t-cell proliferation. Commonly now done with Basilixumab (IL-2 / CD25) 0,4d and methylpred 500mg
5. Maintenance rest of life. NF-Kb agents and prednisone

## Red flags / when to escalate
- TODO: List red flags that require urgent escalation.

## Common pitfalls
- Hyperacute rejection: preformed antibodies against donor antigens e.g. ABO mismatch, HLA haplotype matching (100 antigens tested to avoid pre-sensitized match) - 'virtual crossmatch' . Tested with PRA (panel rejection antibodies)

## References
TODO: Add landmark references or guideline citations.
