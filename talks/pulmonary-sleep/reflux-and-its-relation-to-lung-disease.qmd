## What this covers
- GERD
- Give for 4-8 weeks (4 usually, 8 if esophagitis is present), then attempt to taper to lowest possible dose.
- if no response by 4-8 weeks, consider workup to confirm dx (pH, manometry, or endoscopy)

## Learning objectives
- GERD
- Give for 4-8 weeks (4 usually, 8 if esophagitis is present), then attempt to taper to lowest possible dose.
- if no response by 4-8 weeks, consider workup to confirm dx (pH, manometry, or endoscopy)
- if diagnosis confirmed, BID dosing will decrease time pH < 4, thus may be helpful.
- Don't consider surgery if they don't respond to PPI (won't work)

## Bottom line / summary
- 2020;324(24):2536-2547.
- doi:10.1001/jama.2020.21360
- Definition: recurrent troublesome heartburn or regurgitation OR sequalae (e.g.
- Barrett's esophagus, esophagitis, stricture).
- Not equal to gastritis (less severe, irritation) or dyspepsia (which happens occasionally in all individuals)

## Approach
1. Give for 4-8 weeks (4 usually, 8 if esophagitis is present), then attempt to taper to lowest possible dose.
2. if no response by 4-8 weeks, consider workup to confirm dx (pH, manometry, or endoscopy)
3. if diagnosis confirmed, BID dosing will decrease time pH < 4, thus may be helpful.
4. Don't consider surgery if they don't respond to PPI (won't work)

## Red flags / when to escalate
- TODO: List red flags that require urgent escalation.

## Common pitfalls
- Don't consider surgery if they don't respond to PPI (won't work)
