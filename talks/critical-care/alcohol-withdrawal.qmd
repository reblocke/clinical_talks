- Treating

## Learning objectives
- Who's at risk?
- Timeline and Terms
- Treating
- Phenobarbital

## Bottom line / summary
- PAWSS score - https://www.mdcalc.com/prediction-alcohol-withdrawal-severity-scale
- Reasons to go to an ICU?
- If high risk for severe withdrawal (aka legit history of prior seizures or confounding seizure disorder, withdrawal symptoms with detectable BAL - consider long acting in addition to symptom driven protocol)
- Withdrawal Seizures - 0-48 hours (12-24 after cessation highest risk)
- Note: this might be delayed if getting GABA dsrugs

## Approach
1. Delirium tremens? (Hemodynamic instability, agitation and hallucinations)
2. Using Ativan every 1-2 hours
3. CIWA scores in the 20s that aren't all symptom trigger
4. Concerns about over sedation / airway protection.
5. Up front dose of 10 mg/kg
