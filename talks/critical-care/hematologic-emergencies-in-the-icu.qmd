## What this covers
- Acute Promyelocytic Luekemia
- Leukostasis
- DIC

## Learning objectives
- Acute Promyelocytic Luekemia
- Leukostasis
- DIC
- SVC
- Cord Compression
- TLS
- Cytokine Release Syndrome

## Bottom line / summary
- Often leukopenic (due to fragile cells) vs hyperleukocytosis in other AML, present in DIC/ecchymosis/severe coagulopathy.
- (note: differentiate from hyperviscosity syndrome caused by hyper-proteinemia)
- Definition: 25% increase from baseline of K, Phos, Uric or 25% decrease of Ca
- Go to the binder and call oncology
- ATRA, low risk so makes sense to treat if ambiguous and not excluded.

## Approach
1. ATRA, low risk so makes sense to treat if ambiguous and not excluded.
2. Beware of ATRA differentiation syndrome -> capillary leak physiology. Treat with dexamethasone
3. ATRA induced leukocytosis -> differentiation leads to high WBC. Add doxorubicin
4. Psuedotumor cerebri
5. Hyperleukocytosis over 100k

## Red flags / when to escalate
- TODO: List red flags that require urgent escalation.

## Common pitfalls
- Beware of ATRA differentiation syndrome -> capillary leak physiology. Treat with dexamethasone
- avoid diuretics, PRBCs -> increase viscocity

## References
TODO: Add landmark references or guideline citations.
