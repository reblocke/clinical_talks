## What this covers
- Sedatives
- Anelgesia
- Interventions

## Learning objectives
- Sedatives
- Anelgesia
- Interventions
- Neuromuscular Blockade
- Monitoring

## Bottom line / summary
- Analgesia, Amnesia, and NM blockade
- Analgesia first modality
- Ciastricurium: degraded by Hoffman elimination predictable even in hepatic and renal failure.
- Train of 4 measures neuromuscular blockade by summarizing how many receptors are blocked.
- Gives pulses through a nerve and 2 Hz and sees how many are conducted

## Approach
1. Fentanyl analgosedation (monotherapy) - estimated to be sufficient in 50% of ICU patients (source?)
2. dexmetodomidine - less delirium
3. propfol - fast on/off
4. ketamine
5. ABCDEF bundle

## Red flags / when to escalate

## Common pitfalls
- TODO: Capture common errors or missed steps.

## References
