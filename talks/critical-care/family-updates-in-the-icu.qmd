## What this covers
- Code status when things are going badley
- introduce yourself and the team members.
- clarify when you will be available, or what other team members are available and for how long

## Learning objectives
- Code status when things are going badley
- introduce yourself and the team members.
- clarify when you will be available, or what other team members are available and for how long
- start by asking what they've been told with a flag that you're interested so you can start at the right place, not as a 'quiz' (phrasing it like this can help to avoid the dynamic where they feel like their healthcare literacy is under question and something to be embarrassed about)
- when you give updates, reference specific tests/results
- "What do you think the patient would have wanted" as a frame. Off loads feeling of responsibility
- learning about the patients and values and preferences - what did they really like to do?

## Bottom line / summary
- ##First conversation:
- ##Are they going to be ok?
- Almost no one is ever, with certainty, going to be fine who is in the ICU.
- Your goal should be to have them understand what is wrong with the patient and reassure them that their family will be well cared for.
- introduce yourself and the team members.

## Approach
1. introduce yourself and the team members.
2. clarify when you will be available, or what other team members are available and for how long
3. start by asking what they've been told with a flag that you're interested so you can start at the right place, not as a 'quiz' (phrasing it like this can help to avoid the dynamic where they feel like their healthcare literacy is under question and something to be embarrassed about)
4. when you give updates, reference specific tests/results
5. "What do you think the patient would have wanted" as a frame. Off loads feeling of responsibility

## Red flags / when to escalate
- TODO: List red flags that require urgent escalation.

## Common pitfalls
- start by asking what they've been told with a flag that you're interested so you can start at the right place, not as a 'quiz' (phrasing it like this can help to avoid the dynamic where they feel like their healthcare literacy is under question and something to be embarrassed about)
