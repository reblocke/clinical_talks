## What this covers
- Sweep gas flow rate: controls CO2
- Speed of pump - ECMO Flow rate: controls O2
- FDo2 Of sweep gas: controls O2

## Learning objectives
- Sweep gas flow rate: controls CO2
- Speed of pump - ECMO Flow rate: controls O2
- FDo2 Of sweep gas: controls O2
- Inflow and outflow catheters are too close
- ECMO flow rate is too high.
- Sweep gas flow interruption: often interruption in equipment, leads to circuit apnea.
- Membrane lung failure: gas phase or blood phase failure

## Bottom line / summary
- Basics: https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.34197/ats-scholar.2020-0077VO
- Pathologic recirculation: Blood goes from the outflow track (in SVC) back in to IVC and into the inflow track.
- This leads to ineffective circulation to the body and hypoxemia.
- Monitor pre- and post- blood gas for
- What to do with the ventilator?

## Approach
1. Sweep gas flow rate: controls CO2
2. Speed of pump - ECMO Flow rate: controls O2
3. FDo2 Of sweep gas: controls O2
4. Inflow and outflow catheters are too close
5. ECMO flow rate is too high.
