## What this covers
- Preference Stability
- Surrogate Decision-makers
- Paternalism vs SDM vs Menu

## Learning objectives
- Preference Stability
- Surrogate Decision-makers
- Paternalism vs SDM vs Menu
- identifying a patient who is acutely dying
- Resource allocation

## Bottom line / summary
- In a retrospective cohort study of nonsurgical patients from the California patient discharge database from 2016 to 2018, the authors found that DNR reversals at the time of readmission are common (45.1% of patients readmitted within 30 d following a first DNR hospitalization experienced DNR reversal upon readmission) and patients readmitted to a different hospital versus the same hospital were at higher risk of DNR reversal (p < 0.001).
- They also found that patients readmitted to low versus high DNR rate hospitals were more likely to have DNR reversals, and patients readmitted to a different hospital and with DNR reversal had higher rates of mechanical ventilation and hospital death.
- They also observed a strong hospital effect associated with DNR reversal rates.
- It is unlikely that patients would choose a hospital based on DNR preferences, as hospital-level DNR practices are neither reported nor in the public domain.
- This raises the important issue of the effect of hospital characteristics.

## Approach
1. Goals of Care
2. Preference Stability
3. Surrogate Decision-makers
