## What this covers
- Airways - 8x higher failure rate (13x fatal) -> generally anesthesia does airway
- Decreased FRC.
- Differences:

## Learning objectives
- Airways - 8x higher failure rate (13x fatal) -> generally anesthesia does airway
- Decreased FRC.
- Differences:
- Hemodynamics (increased plasma volume, CO increases 30-50% by SV and HR, SVR decreases, and so normal blood pressure decreases. > consequence is that more blood loss can occur without hemodynamic changes
- 12-14 weeks and beyond: Aorta and IVC compresses and decreases CO -> L tilt 15-20 degrees to displace the uterus.
- Respiratory physiology: FRC decreases, O2 consumption increased 20-30%, airway edema -> decreased ability to tolerate apnea. (MV increases due to greater tidal volume; chronic compensated respiratory alkalsosis 30 paco2, HCO3 18-20 is normal > BiPAP? Physiologic rationale. Theoretical risk of aspiration but hasn’t empirically panned out.
- Thresholds for respiratory support

## Bottom line / summary
- Airways - 8x higher failure rate (13x fatal) -> generally anesthesia does airway
- Hemodynamics (increased plasma volume, CO increases 30-50% by SV and HR, SVR decreases, and so normal blood pressure decreases.
