### Slide 4
- Common Methods of Identifying Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure Produce Meaningfully Different CohortsBrian Locke, Krishna Sundar, Jeanette Brown, Ramikiran Gouripeddi
- Hypothesis 1: The methods used in prior studies of hypercapnic respiratory failure (billing code-, procedural code-, and blood-gas-based criteria) identify different patients.
- Outcome: Relative Sensitivity; Positive Predictive Agreement
- Hypothesis 2: The cohorts created by these differ methods differ in risk for outcomes of interest, which hampers interpretation of these studies.
- Outcome: distribution of age, ethnicity, BMI, and frequency of coexisting diagnoses (OSA, opiate use disorder, COPD, CHF, and neuromuscular disease)
- 69 Million MRNs aggregated from 50 academic medical centers
- Deidentified patient level data, including admissions, diagnoses, medications, procedures, and lab values.
- Missing data?
### Slide 5

- Relative sensitivity (vs ABG): 19.8%
- Positive Predictive Agreement (vs ABG): 47.0%
- NIV Group:
- Relative sensitivity (vs ABG): 15.2%
- Positive Predictive Agreement (vs ABG): 45.2%

### Slide 7
- For accurate determination of
- Frequency of different comorbidities or component causes
- Morbidity and mortality associated with hypercapnia
- Who should be included in future studies to determine frequency benefit from treatment
- ... method of patient identification likely matters
- Interpretability of current research could be improved using standard case definitions (EHR Phenotype)
- How should we identify these patients for studies?

### Slide 9
- Changes in Bicarbonate in Patients at Risk for Obesity Hypoventilation Undergoing Bariatric SurgeryBrian Locke, Conrad Addison, Somya Mishra, Krishna Sundar
- ERS 2018: Obesity-related hypoventilation paradigm
### Slide 10
- Changes in Bicarbonate in Patients at Risk for Obesity Hypoventilation Undergoing Bariatric SurgeryBrian Locke, Conrad Addison, Somya Mishra, Krishna Sundar
- Hypothesis 1: [HCO3-] has low enough biologic variation to functional usable surrogate for nocturnal CO2 retention peri-bariatric surgery
- Outcome: intra-patient variability in measurement, frequency of metabolic disturbances
- Hypothesis 2: Δ[HCO3-] has construct validity as an index of response to interventions that decrease nocturnal CO2 loading
- Δ[HCO3-] will be higher in patients who lose more weight, who start and adhere to CPAP.
### Slide 11
- [HCO3-] – day of surgery
- Patients: n359 patients who underwent bariatric surgery (mostly bypass) 2011-2016 at U of U
- Exposures: time of OSA dx, CPAP use, Maximum weight loss
- Outcome: Change in 6-mo, 1-yr, 2-yr [HCO3-]

- Other analyses:
- % of patients meeting ERS II or higher OHS
- % Excluded due to metabolic process
### Slide 12
- Changes in Bicarbonate in Patients at Risk for Obesity Hypoventilation Undergoing Bariatric SurgeryBrian Locke, Conrad Addison, Somya Mishra, Krishna Sundar
- Exclusions:
- (n32,27 w/o pre-, post- data)
- n15 on diuretic
- n20 on topiramate
- n 24 on chronic opiates
- n9 on other med
- n9 sCr over 1.3
- 26% have reason to expect
- 59 of 222 (26.6%) patients with ERS 2+ OHS
- Weight loss Nadir at 12 months then weight regain [median 5kg]
- No HCO3 ‘regain’
- Regression to the mean
### Slide 13
- Changes in Bicarbonate in Patients at Risk for Obesity Hypoventilation Undergoing Bariatric SurgeryBrian Locke, Conrad Addison, Somya Mishra, Krishna Sundar
- Proposed re-analysis:
- Missing data: multiple imputation with chained equations
- What proportion of variability of [HCO3-] is inter-vs-intra person? Intraclass correlation coefficient
- Multilevel (mixed effect) regression model of [HCO3-] with predictor variables: starting [HCO3-], OSA severity (or diagnosis), CPAP adherence, weight loss
- Outputs continuous; loses interpretability of dichotomization
- Parallel Coordinate plot (e.g. at side)
