## Slide outline
### Slide 1
- TODO: No text extracted from this slide.
### Slide 2
- Populations that may benefit from aggressive OSA case finding?
- Cardiovascular disease prevention: patient selection and/or effect size?
- Cognitive outcomes? Cancer outcomes? Developing
- Ventilatory Failure: very high rate of unrecognized disease; very high risk of readmission; preliminary data of effectiveness in some subgroups
- Data (Overlap) [ ] find Paper
- Need: characterize comorbidity profiles, what physiologic endotypes are present, and which features predict risk or treatment response.
### Slide 3
- Acute Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure
- Recurrent Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure
- Chronic Hypercapnia
- Acute on Chronic Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure
- Hypercapnia Trajectories
- Hypercapnia
- Normalization of Hypercapnia
- Normal CO2 on labs
- Hypercapnia on labs
- Increasing CO2
- Assessment 1
- Assessment
- 2
- Assessment 3
- Common: COPD
- Common: OHS
- PaCO2 at discharge (not HCO3), Severity classification are associated with persistence (DOI: 10.1159/000524845)
- High PaCO2 and Prior Acute NIV predict recurrence (DOI: 10.1111/resp.12652)
### Slide 4
- No RCTs have addressed this question
- 10 observational studies (3 studies of hospitalized cohorts, 6 with hospitalized subgroups); serious risk of bias.
- “After adjusting for age, sex, and baseline PaCO2, the odds ratios (ORs) for [90-day] mortality were significantly lower in the group discharged on PAP (adjusted OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.08–0.33)”
### Slide 5
- Post-AECOPD trials
- Mode: BPAPS/T
- Driving pressure
- Timing of start after acute exacerbation
- RESCUE vs HOT-HMV
- (Not Post Exacerbation)
- Many in control resolved hypercapnia
- 21% excluded at 2-4 weeks.
### Slide 6
- Timing of NIV: COPD vs OHS
- “Guidelines for chronic hypercapnic COPD recommend a 2- to 4-week recovery period following hospitalization for COPD exacerbation before assessing for noninvasive ventilation to confirm that chronic hypercapnia is persistent (eg, PaCO2 ≥ 52 mm Hg)”
- This recommendation is derived from the fact that 21% of patients with COPD recruited for the Home Oxygen Therapy-Home Mechanical Ventilation (HOT-HMV) trial were excluded because the hypercapnia on discharge resolved after 2 to 4 weeks.
- Conversely, the guidelines for OHS suggest hospitalized patients with OHS be continued on PAP therapy following hospital discharge until they undergo polysomnography, ideally within the first 3 months of discharge.6
- This recommendation is driven by a mortality difference at 3 months postdischarge between patients with OHS discharged without PAP (16.8%) and with PAP (2.3%).14
### Slide 7
- Admitted to hospital (Floor or ICU) with ABG showing PaCO2 over 45 mmHg and pH 7.35-7.45
- Collider bias
### Slide 8
- Do NOT start at hospitalization
- wait 2-4 weeks to see if acute on chronic becomes chronic.
- In-lab PSG not recommended for pure-COPD; attempt to normalized pCO2.
- AVAPS not better than PS
### Slide 9
- Resmed & Inovalon Insights, LLC payor claims database: 6810 pts with a COPD diagnostic code in the year before device set up
- Matching: sex, comorbidities, COPD-related HC usage in prior year
- Propensity score for CPAP adherence
- Outcomes: ↓ER Visit and Hospitalizations
- Critique: healthy adherer bias
### Slide 10
- Critique of the Sufficient-Component Model
- Consider PKU: Genetic defect causes disease when phenylalinine consumed.
- -> in practice, everyone eats phenylalinine: genetic attributable fraction 100%
- -> however, modification of diet avoids development. Thus, if phenylalanine consumption varies then environment contributes
- Consider, the hypothetical world where everyone has the PKU gene, but phenylalanine varies (lower diagram) – then, the disease is ALL environmental.
- what is the relationship to mendelian randomization?
- -> population attributable fraction (and percent variance explained) is not generalizable, and changes as covariates change. Applied to Hypercapnia?
### Slide 11
- Consider this as a missing data problem? What is the propensity of p(ABG)?
- Could P(ABG) – by provider ideall (or institution) work as an instrument? (to wiggle the likelihood of a diagnosis… could you test that? Are high p(ABG) environments or providers more likely to apply the diagnosis?
- [ ] casual inference podcast on instrumental variables.
### Slide 12
- CO2 Homeostasis: Factors Causing Frailty
- High ventilatory need:
- Increased CO2 Production
- Increased Deadspace ‘Wasted Vent’
- Low desired PaCO2
- Fever, Infection, or Inflammation
- Advanced malignancy
- Muscle activity
- Seizures
- Exercise
- ↑↑ Work of breathing
- Toxic ingestion
- Obesity
- Anatomic
- shallow breathing
- Physiologic
- Pulmonary embolism
- Pulmonary hypertension
- Congestive heart failure
- Parenchymal lung disease of any kind
- Metabolic acidosis
- Hypoxia
- Unable to breathe:
- Muscle weakness or inefficiency
- Increased respiratory system loads
- Neuromuscular disease
- Lung Hyperinflation
- Respiratory muscle hypoxia
- Elevated airway resistance
- COPD, Asthma
- Mucus
- Upper-airway obstruction
- Stiff Lungs
- Parenchymal lung disease
- Pulmonary edema
- Stiff Chest Wall
- Pleural disease
- Excess or stiff chest wall tissue
- Decreased Drive to Breathe:
- Opiates and other sedatives
- Brainstem lesions
- Compensated hypercapnia
- Sleep
- Metabolic alkalosis
- Red OHS, as an example
### Slide 13
- Predispositions to Exacerbations
- Parabola assumes constant production of CO2 and efficiency of the lung
- As Ventilation drops, each further drop causes proportionally more CO2 accumulation.
- Analogous to creatinine & GFR
### Slide 14
- PAO2 FiO2 (PB-47)—(PaCO2/R)  O2 17.8 mmHg lower at 4500ft
- Hypercapnia in SLC
- SpO2 is routinely obtained in clinical practice, PaCO2 (or TcCO2) is not
- SLC  earlier identification
### Slide 15
- Hypotheses: on first (physiologic) principles
- Many will have the first time they manifest respiratory frailty during an exacerbation
- This group will be at high risk for repeat exacerbations
- Major source of morbidity, mortality, and cost to the system
- Interventions to reduce frailty or physiologic stressors may reduce exacerbations
- Better evidence is needed to support these practices to streamline payor funding
- If many of these patients are missed during presentation, or proper management is not instituted, this is a lost opportunity.

### Slide 17
- Gap
- Clinical impression suggests that patients admitted with hypercapnia are a clinically heterogenous group, but few multi-center descriptions exist.
- It is not clear if physiologically important subgroups (e.g. high-drive to breathe vs low; ventilatory failure vs hypercapnic respiratory success) can be discriminated on the basis of data elements in the EHR
- A variety of methods have been used in prior studies, generally using blood gas-based assessments, diagnostic-codes, procedure codes for ventilation, or some combination of these.
- However, it is not clear if the methods that have used these criteria select similar groups of patients, or if they select representative patients.
- This is a problem for interpreting the meaning of findings
