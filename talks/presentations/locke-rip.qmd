### Slide 1
- PGR Jan 30: What’s new with CO2Clinical Epidemiology of Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure
- Presenter: Brian W Locke MS MSCI

- Intermountain Medical Center
- COI: MTN, time-series machine learning on continuous sensor data.
- Funding:

- To be reviewed K23: Bioinformatics Tools to Quantify the Disease Burden Associated with Hypercapnia
### Slide 2
- Overarching hypothesis
- Advice: ‘study what makes you mad’
- The inpatient to outpatient care transition for patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure is horrible.
- I suspect we’d achieve better outcomes by
- systematically identifying patients with hypercapnia
- Establishing an evidence base for undifferentiated ventilatory failure
- consistently implementing measures to mitigate their risks.
### Slide 3
- Background: Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure
- Population-standardized prevalence PaCO2 > 45 mmHg after excluding iatrogenic causes:
- 150 per 100,000 person/year
- Inpatient ICD code for Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure
- 23% 30d readmission rate
- Same as CHF, more than MI
- Usually (66%) with recurrent hypercapnia
- Common contributors to Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure:
- Advanced Age
- Opiate Use
- Obesity
- Advanced Lung Dz
- Multimorbidity
### Slide 4
- Hypercapnia Projects
- Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure Diagnostic Workups in Utah
- Racial inequity in diagnosis?
- Case definitions for hypercapnia are inconsistent
- Methods of identification: TcCO2 and machine learning.

### Slide 8
- TODO: No text extracted from this slide.
### Slide 9
- Next Steps:
- Individual patient data is in regulatory approval
- Recreate pre-research analysis, with additional covariates and outcomes
- Covariates: prior diagnoses, demographics
- Mediators: DME orders, Medication Fills, Specialist Referrals, Diagnostic Testing
- Outcomes: Presentation to ED/Urgent, Re-hospitalization, Mortality
- Linkage to Intermountain Health:
- cohort creation with lab data (ABG, VBG, Diagnostic Modeling)
### Slide 10
- Differences in the Diagnosis of Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure by Race and Ethnicity
- Diagnosis disparities in hypoxemic respiratory failure are well documented; less is known about hypercapnic respiratory failure
- Hypothesis: the method of diagnosis (ABG, VBG, or both) of hypercapnic respiratory failure differs between race/ethnicities, which has implications for treatment (device) qualifications
- TriNetX (aggregated health records from 76 hospitals in the United States)
- Adult encounters occurring between January 1 and December 31, 2022
- Ambulatory, emergency department, and hospitalized patients
- Non-missing race/ethnicity information
### Slide 11
- Analysis
- 1°: Among patients who receive a diagnosis code for hypercapnic respiratory failure based on day-1 evidence,
- Multinomial logistic regression, 3-outcomes ABG PaCO2 ≥ 45 mmHg only, VBG PCO2 ≥ 50 mmHg only, or ABG & VBG
- adjust for the type of encounter (ambulatory, emergency, inpatient), age, sex, and region of the U.S. (West, Midwest, South, or Northeast)
- 2°: Why?
- Difference in propensity for ABG?
- Different severity of disease?
- Different propensity to label as Hypercapnia?

### Slide 13
- Why?
- Propensity for ABG & VBG
- Different disease severity
- Propensity for ICD label | CO2
- Logistic GEE (encounter type, region, age, sex, cat. BMI)
- Distribution of PCO2 | ABG, VBG
- Density Plot
- Logistic GEE (enctounter type, region, PCO2-spline, HCO3-spline)
### Slide 14
- Why?
- Propensity for ABG & VBG
- Different disease severity
- Propensity for ICD label | CO2
- Logistic GEE (encounter type, region, age, sex, cat. BMI)
- Distribution of PCO2 | ABG, VBG
- Density Plot
- Logistic GEE (encounter type, region, PCO2-spline, HCO3-spline)
### Slide 15
- Why?
- Propensity for ABG & VBG
- Different disease severity
- Propensity for ICD label | CO2
- Logistic GEE (encounter type, region, age, sex, cat. BMI)
- Distribution of PCO2 | ABG, VBG
- Density Plot
- Logistic GEE (encounter type, region, PCO2-spline, HCO3-spline)
### Slide 16
- Limitations
- Inability to account for hospital- and provider- level behavior
- Unable to control for all relevant confounders (eg disease severity)
- potential for incomplete ascertainment of outcomes.
- Difference in diagnosis vs Disparity in diagnosis?
- Does this translate to downstream consequences?
- Maybe VBG diagnosis is a good thing and device qualifications need to change?
### Slide 17
- Take home points
- Study Question: Are minoritized patients more likely to be diagnosed with hypercapnic respiratory failure on VBG-only evidence?
- Results: In nationwide aggregated health record data, Black patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure were 8.8% (7.2-10.5%) more likely to be diagnosed with VBG-only evidence. This may result from differing propensities to undergo VBG (higher) and ABG (lower) sampling, rather than differences in disease severity or diagnostic labeling.
- Interpretation: Where therapeutic interventions rely on results from arterial sampling (e.g. home NIV), Black patients may be at increased risk for lower-quality care.
### Slide 18
- The Consistency of Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure Case Definitions in Electronic Health Record Data
- Hypothesis: case definitions in use identify importantly different patients
- Literature Review
- Emulation Dataset
- Literature reviews of studies of any-cause hypercapnia
- Assess overlap of the case definitions in TriNetX database
- 15 studies using 13 case definitions to identify patients with hypercapnia.
- 3 included elements that couldn’t be emulated in EHR data (screen ABG, NIV on d/c, consultation)
- N445,686 U.S. adults from 76 institutions who had at least one characteristic that should make a reasonable clinician suspect hypercapnia may be present during 2022
- Cohen’s kappa (κ, agreement beyond chance)

### Slide 23
- Take-Home Points
- Study Question: Do the case definitions for hypercapnic respiratory failure in health record data identify the same, or similar, patients?
- Results: Applying ten case-definitions from the published literature to a large, aggregated nationwide dataset of health records identified different patients (median kappa of 0.35) who had widely variable characteristics and outcomes.
- Interpretation: Case definitions for identifying hypercapnic respiratory failure in health record data create substantively different cohorts, which hampers the synthesis of research findings.

- Sens: 84.2%
- Spec: 91.0%,
- NPV: 93.0% @ 30.3% prev.
- PPV: 80.4%. @ 30.3% prev
- Next: Context specific estimates
- Validation amongst no-ABG pts.
### Slide 26
- Next Steps
- Link Intermountain Health – Select Health
- Cost and utilization data
- Assess patient-, unit-, institution-variation in post-discharge management in the Intermountain Health System
- Outcomes: Select-Health and APCD
- UPDB-Intermountain linkage
- Effect of that variation on ED/readmissions, mortality
### Slide 27
- Overdiagnosis: a diagnosis that does not benefit the patient.
- Fair Umpires: existence and extent of overdiagnosis may be considered using the following questions:
- Are people diagnosed by diagnostic strategy 2 but not by diagnostic strategy 1 at an increased risk of disease specific clinical outcomes if left untreated compared to people not diagnosable by diagnostic strategy 1 or 2 (prognosis evidence)?
- Does diagnosis and treatment of people who are detected using diagnostic strategy 2 but not detected using diagnostic strategy 1 result in an increased beneficial reduction in disease specific clinical outcomes that outweighs the ensuing increased risk of harms, compared to no diagnosis or treatment (utility evidence)?
