## Slide outline
### Slide 1
- TRIP: Jan 18, 2022Who has hypercapnic respiratory failure?
- Brian Locke, MD Pulmonary and Critical Care Fellow; 1st year MSCI
- Team:
- Krishna Sundar, MD P/CCM
- Jeanette Brown, MD PhD P/CCM
- Ram Gouripeddi MBBS MS
### Slide 2
- Respiratory Failure: failure to maintain O2 or CO2 levels in the blood
- If the R ‘sprocket’ (lung) turns too slowly relative to the L sprocket (muscle), CO2 build up in the blood
- This is hypercapnic respiratory failure
- Similar: ‘hypoventilation’, ‘hypercapnia’
- There are 2 types of causes:
- The lung ventilation is severely broken (sprocket can’t turn fast)
- The ‘controller’ doesn’t crank up the speed of the sprocket.
- Build up here CO2 in blood rises
### Slide 3
- Sufficient-Component Cause Model
- Sufficient cause: a set of factors that will cause disease when present
- Component cause: a factor that, if not present, no disease would occur
- Necessary cause: in all sufficient cause sets, this component must be present
- 3 Different Sufficient Causes
- A – J Component Cause
- A Necessary Cause
### Slide 4
- Causes of Hypercapnia
- Severe COPD
- Sufficient Cause
- If PaCO2 > 52 mmHg, 2-4 weeks after exacerbation -> nighttime ventilation improves outcomes
- no other causes of ↑️ CO2
- [Area represents a population of patients]
### Slide 5
- Causes of Hypercapnia
- Severe COPD
- Obesity Hypovent
- Sufficient Cause
- BMI over 35, no other lung dz, PaCO2>45 – nocturnal ventilation improves outcomes
- no other causes of ↑️ CO2
### Slide 6
- Causes of Hypercapnia
- Severe COPD
- Obesity Hypovent
- ALS
- Sufficient Cause
- FVC <50%, nocturnal hypoventilation or sleep problems -> nocturnal ventilation improves outcomes
- no other causes of ↑️ CO2
### Slide 7
- Causes of Hypercapnia: Hypothesis
- Severe COPD
- Obesity Hypovent
- ALS
- COPD as Component Cause
- Muscular weakness as Component Cause
- Obesity as Component Cause
### Slide 8
- Causes of Hypercapnia: Hypothesis
- Severe COPD
- Obesity Hypovent
- ALS
- COPD as Component Cause
- Muscular weakness as Component Cause
- Obesity as Component Cause
- Opiates as Component Cause
- Loop Diuretics as Component Cause
- Sleep Apnea as Component Cause
### Slide 9
- Multicausality
- Obesity
- Untreated
- Sleep Apnea
- COPD
- Loop diuretic
- Opiates
- Sufficient cause: a set of factors that will cause disease when present
- Component cause: a factor that, if not present, no disease would occur
- Necessary cause: in all sufficient sets, this component must be present
- Hypothetical patient with hypercapnic respiratory failure
### Slide 10
- Is there evidence for multicausality?
- Admitted to ICU with PaCO2 over 45 mmHg and a pH less than 7.35
- Overall prevalence of OSA ( AHI > 30 ) in survivors over 50%
- P (OSA | Hypercapnia) >> P (OSA)
- association, not causation
### Slide 11
- ”Yes, of course. Who cares?”
- What are the common component causes of hypercapnia?
- Need pretest probabilities to inform rational diagnostic testing
- What proportion of cases do we have evidence to inform management decisions?
- Might all the other patients benefit from nocturnal ventilation?
- Payors won’t pay without evidence.
- Why haven’t these questions been answered?
### Slide 12
- Inferential leaps:
- Are common comorbidities Associations vs Causes? Takes additionally robust study designs to know for sure.
- Current proposal: e.g., risk of readmission
- Inferences about effects who to generalize previously demonstrated treatments to: The Reference Class Problem.. Are patients with “component cause” COPD likely to benefit in the same way that “Sufficient cause” COPD are?
- NIV is PAYOR dependent – thus whether or not clinicians make this leap, payor’s will likely only pay for treatments under a population of interest.
- Interesting that medicine has allowed this state with respect to this treatment
### Slide 13
- Severe COPD
- Obesity Hypovent
- ALS
- COPD as Component Cause
- Muscular weakness as Component Cause
- Obesity as Component Cause
- Opiates as Component Cause
- Loop Diuretics as Component Cause
- All cases of hypercapnic respiratory failure
- Where do we draw this line? (who is included as a ’case’)
- Sleep Apnea as Component Cause
### Slide 14
- Case definition: hypercapnic respiratory failure
- PaCO2 over 45 mmHg (at sea level)
- Up to 10 mmHg higher in REM sleep
- Arbitrary thresholds
- Challenges:
- Hypercapnic respiratory failure is uncommon and can be transient, acute, or chronic.
- The symptoms are variable, and the diagnosis is frequently missed.
- Blood gasses hurt to obtain, not commonly obtained unless clinicians suspect diagnosis
### Slide 15
- How is the current literature identifying hypercapnia?
- Admitted (ICU or floor) with one of the following diagnostic codes:
- J96.02 (acute hypercapnic respiratory failure)
- J96.22 (acute and chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia)
- J96.92 (respiratory failure unspecifed with hypercapnia)
- J96.12 (chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia)
- E66.2 (morbid obesity with hypoventilation)
- Diagnostic Code-Based
### Slide 16
- Currently, how is hypercapnia identified?
- Lab-Based
- Admitted to hospital (Floor or ICU) with ABG showing PaCO2 over 45 mmHg and pH 7.35-7.45
### Slide 17
- Currently, how is hypercapnia identified?
- Lab and procedure code-Based
- Admitted to the ICU
- PaCO2 greater than 47.25 mmHg
- Procedure code for non-invasive ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation initiation
### Slide 18
- Inpatients (ICU or Floor)
- Identified by initial ABG PaCO2 over 45, “excluded iatrogenic causes/sedation”.
### Slide 19
- Project 1: Hypotheses
- The methods used in prior studies of hypercapnic respiratory failure identify different patients
- Hypothesis 1: the sensitivity (aka recall) and positive predictive value (aka precision) for both billing code- and procedural code-based identification of hypercapnic respiratory failure will be below 80%, when compared to blood gas-based identification as the reference standard.
- The populations identified by differ in risk for outcomes of interest, which hampers interpretation of these studies.
- Hypothesis 2: The distribution of age, ethnicity, BMI, Elixhauser comorbidity score, and frequency of coexisting diagnoses (OSA, opiate use disorder, COPD, CHF, and neuromuscular disease) will differ between the cohorts identified by each method.

### Slide 28
- Implications:
- For accurate determination of
- Frequency of different comorbidities or causes
- Morbidity and mortality associated with hypercapnia
- Who should be included in studies to determine benefit from treatment
- ... method of patient identification likely matters
- Interpretability of current research could be improved using standard case definitions
### Slide 29
- Challenges: Data Quality
- U of U does not submit ABG results to TriNetX
- Each individual patient MUST have been eligible to be identified by each strategy.
- How to avoid similar issues at other institutions?
- Requirement: data check for submission of all 3 types of information from each institution (they are labeled)
- Assumption: data missingness determined by institution-level policies
- Variability in practices by institution
- Bug, or feature?
### Slide 30
- Challenges: Reference Standard
- What should the reference standard be?
- Does transient elevation PaCO2 after opiate administration imply respiratory failure?
- Technically yes, but the implication of the diagnosis is much different
- How much heterogeneity should the definition have?
- Current PaCO2 threshold (45mmHg at sea level; 42 mmHg in SLC) are arbitrary
- No epidemiologic data to support.
- Different threshold used for different questions (NIV in COPD 52 mmHg; 45 mmHg other)
### Slide 31
- Computable Phenotype
- Informed presence bias: people who have information in the EHR differ from those who do not.
- What would the ABG have shown, if it were checked? Hard to predict
- EHR Computable Phenotype: an algorithm to classify patients based on the information present in the EHR
- EHR Computable phenotype for Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure?
- What should the reference standard be?
- Physician adjudication? Chart Review
- Based on some outcome measure: ie, risk of mortality or readmission
### Slide 32
- Next steps
- To achieve initial aims:
- Data quality checks; requires relational database processing. Currently ongoing
- Additional aims?
- TriNetX has record-linkage with mortality indices. Does the cohort definition influence risk of mortality?
### Slide 33
- Where Will This Lead? Open questions
- Hypercapnic Respiratory is better understood by multicausality
- Which component causes commonly lead to disease?
- Are there component causes that are not generally mono-causal sufficient causes? Impact of loop diuretic prescription on risk of readmission with hypercapnia
- Current methods identify meaningfully different cohorts; standard definitions needed to answer:
- Per patient, the costs/morbidity/mortality of hypercapnic patients is extremely high
- How large is the burden to society (incidence, mortality)?
- Current evidence supports treatment in a subset of patients with mono-causal hypercapnia
- How small is this subset? We aim to find out
- Will treating individual component causes improve outcomes?
- Mechanistic reasoning suggests it should; we need data
