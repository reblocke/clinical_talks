## Slide outline
### Slide 1
- fellow researchfrom a fellow fellow
- disclaimer: what follows are my views and not the views of…
- Brian Locke
### Slide 2
- 3 Components of a Project:
- Research Question
- Data
- Methods
- Consider each before proceeding…
### Slide 3
- Research Question
- Significance
- Contingency
- Tractability
- Neglected-ness
- Leverage
- x
- Traditional Paradigm
- ”Free Range” Approach
- Find a mentor who is investigating what you are interested in.
- Learn how to do what they are doing
- Ultimately branch out later in your career
- Formulate a question that interests you
- Determine what data you can use to answer it
- Find a group of collaborators
- The only thing that works for
- You’re limited to what people are doing
- Might flop; big time investment
### Slide 4
- TODO: No text extracted from this slide.
### Slide 5
- Why do mentors mentor?
- Intrinsic:
- Training the Next Generation; Improve Medicine; Fun
- Incentives:
- Clinical Track (majority) – need impact outside of the institution (“excellence”) in 2 of: Clinical Care, Education, Administration, and Research
- Tenure Track or similar (minority) – hired (and promoted) to get extra-mural grants: you are helpful to the extent you facility this (publications, preliminary work).
- Favors executing previously-conceived projects; has ability/skill
### Slide 6
- What Data Are You Going To Use
- Database work
- Chart Review
- Meta-research
- Survey
- Prospective
- Basic Science
- Do we have access to it now?
- How much data-cleaning is needed?
- Can it answer the question?
- How big?
- How long will it take?
- Can it be used for multiple things?
- Systematic Reviews with or without meta-analysis
- Who will be surveyed and how will it be done?
- Do a feasibility study at most.
- ???
### Slide 7
- What Data Are You Going To Use
- Database work
- Chart Review
- Meta-research
- Survey
- Prospective
- Basic Science
- Do we have access to it now?
- How much data-cleaning is needed?
- Can it answer the question?
- How big?
- How long will it take?
- Can it be used for multiple things?
- Systematic Reviews with or without meta-analysis
- Who will be surveyed and how will it be done?
- Do a feasibility study at most.
- ???
- Data cleaning is time/expertise intensive
- Chart Review is low yield
- Time (and team) intensive
- Unique methods expertise; limited impact
- Inflexible time commitment, mentor dependent
### Slide 8
- Databases
- Health-Record Data
- TriNetX -> Ram Gouripeddi
- Epic Cosmos -> Vik Deshmukh (IM pays for expedited data requests)
- ICU Databases:
- Community Cohorts:
- Trial Data:
### Slide 9
- Methods:
- Who is going to do the statistics?
- Who will help you design the study?
- “Traditional Mentorship Structure”: they provide
- Otherwise… resources:
- CTSI
- MSCI
### Slide 10
- How can I help?
- What Can I Offer?
- What I Can’t Offer
- I have some ideas
- I can do (and teach) the needed study design, epi/statistics, and database skills
- I want (and am incentivized) to collaborate or advise on other projects
- I think it is very helpful to have external advisors
- I’ve (big) helped with Brittany and Jeff’s projects and (little) helped with Ryan, Jared, and Darren’s
- I cannot provide resources (statisticians, study coordinators, grad students)
- I cannot offer advocacy that carries weight
- I would not be a wise primary-mentor for someone who wants a primary research career
- But, I can help
### Slide 11
- Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure: Overall research premise
- inflicts a high burden of disease (prevalence morbidity)
- is becoming a bigger problem (obesity, opiates, multimorbidity)
- is (potentially) treatable with NIV, GLP-1Ra, etc.
- but the current evidence base is inadequate
- is comparatively neglected (biases against this type of patient)
- Therefore, doing a better job recognizing hypercapnia will allow:
- Better quantification (ie. research) about hypercapnia’s impacts
- Better care for patients with known best management.
### Slide 12
- Completed Research
### Slide 13
- Proposed Research (at least 2025 – 2030):
- OVERALL: Patients with Consequentially-Missed Hypercapnia can be Identified Using Health Record Elements
- OVERALL: There is a significant burden of unrecognized hypercapnia among hospitalized patients.
- 3 aims
- Aim 1: Use NLP / AI to incorporate unstructured data
- Aim 2: Prospective Validation of Positive Predictive Value
- Aim 3: Assess Potential Impact of Unrecognized Hypercapnia
- Hypothesis
- RN/ED Triage note symptoms
- simple NLP (CLAMP) vs
- Large-Language Models
- ‘Risk’-modeling can identify inpatients missed by their teams
- Patients predicted likely to have had unrecognized hypercapnia suffer adverse outcomes, like readmission.
- Rationale
- Signs/Symptoms improve accuracy
- e.g. STOP-BANG for OSA
- Must be verified to identify unrecognized hypercapnia
- Would expanded recognition lead to overdiagnosis?
- Approach
- Train & evaluate performance on retrospective, local health records
- Prospectively apply TcCO2 to inpatients predicted likely to have hypercapnia – do they?
- ↑readmission mortality In patients who likely had hypercapnia?
- # likely hypercapnia admissions prior to actual recognition?
- Payoff: Allow hypercapnic respiratory failure -not dependent on clinician identification- as an exposure or outcome
- Career Development: Skillset bridging bioinformatics and clinical investigation required to validate promising technology
### Slide 14
- In the interim, preliminary work needed…
- strengthen the case to investigate hypercapnia
- augment tools to study hypercapnia epi
- Inpatient Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure
- ABG CO2>45 vs VBG CO2>50
- Who gets steroids / antibiotics / diuretics
- National Consequence of ↑ICD
- Who is diagnosed / managed as OHS?
- Dysutility of FP vs FN during hypercap workup
- Hypothesis
- Vent Support, Dx is equivalent
- Most get kitchen sink
- High Readmission Rates
- Conditions that exclude OHS vary
- FN currently underweighted
- Data
- TriNetX (cleaning done)
- National Inpatient Sample
- Survey
- Group Session Survey
- Methods
- Descriptive Stats, Regressions
- Descriptive Stats, Regression
- Randomized Vignette’s
- Anchor-based
- Team
- Somya Mishra (Anesth/Sleep Fellow)
- Chaiyakunapruk (Pharm/Econ)
### Slide 15
- Immersive Virtual Reality – Joseph Finkelstein MD PhD MA, Dept Bioinformatics
- VR: immersive (headset) vs non-immersive (computer game).
- Immersion is the experience of being absorbed (termed, ‘presence’), forgetting their embodied presence and thus responding as if the environment is real.
- ICU Use cases: Relaxation (several feasibility studies), Cognitive/physical mobilization (1 RCT), Distraction/pain control (1 RCT pre-op), Delirium, Sleep (1 +RCT)
- Feasibility Study (done) → Next Steps?
### Slide 16
- Hypercap. Diagnosis: ABG vs VBG
- Problem: Emergency room providers often use VBGs to “diagnose” hypercapnia, but it’s unclear if they get managed like ABG-diagnosed
- Study Question: Do patients admitted with VBGs suggestive of hypercapnia
- Receive the same care (ie. ICD-codes of hypercapnic resp failure)
- Have the same outcomes (ie. intubation rate, NIV use)
- As those with ABGs confirming hypercapnia?
- Data: Nationally aggregated EHR (TriNetX) of patients
- Methods: Inverse Probability (of A/VBG)-Weighted Comparison
### Slide 17
- Hypercapnia Diagnostics: Harm of FP vs FN
- Problem: Thresholds for any test [e.g. HCO3- level, Modeled Pr(Hypercap)] should be defined to minimize the dis-utility of incorrect results. No evidence exists for hypercapnia diagnosis.
- Study Question: How bad is it to miss hypercapnia in comparison to overtesting/overdiagnosing it?
- Data: Survey (initially, providers – via Hosp/PCCM/Sleep groups)
- Methods: survey
### Slide 18

### Slide 20
- Jeanette Brown MD PhD
- VR: immersive (headset) vs non-immersive (computer game).
- Immersion is the experience of being absorbed (termed, ‘presence’), forgetting their embodied presence and thus responding as if the environment is real.
- ICU Use cases: Relaxation (several feasibility studies), Cognitive/physical mobilization (1 RCT), Distraction/pain control (1 RCT pre-op), Delirium, Sleep (1 +RCT)
- Feasibility Study (done) → Next Steps?
