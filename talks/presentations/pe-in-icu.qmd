## Learning objectives
- Non-trivial PE
- Shock from PE?
- Systemic Lytics
- Can you Lyse?

- Shock from PE?
- Systemic Lytics
- Can you Lyse?
- Still in Shock from PE?

## Approach
1. TODO: Outline the initial assessment or decision point.
2. TODO: Outline the next diagnostic or management step.
3. TODO: Outline follow-up or escalation criteria.

## Red flags / when to escalate
- TODO: List red flags that require urgent escalation.

## Common pitfalls
- TODO: Capture common errors or missed steps.

## References
TODO: Add landmark references or guideline citations.
