### Slide 20
- Summary (Part 1)
- Obstruction occurs because after the initial burst, we don’t volitionally control our exhalation speed – depends on lung mechanics
- An FEV1/FVC that is too low defines obstruction
- The exact threshold is arbitrary, debatable
- Post-BD FEV1/FVC defines diagnoses, but BD response has no role in diagnosis.
### Slide 21
- What’s the weakest link?
### Slide 22
- Implication: impaired lung function doesn’t always cause dyspnea (on exertion)
- Warning: air hunger is extremely aversive; people will modify their behavior to avoid it and not realize they have excess dyspnea on exertion.
### Slide 23
- COPD: chronic bronchitis or emphysema
- Chronic Bronchitis
- COPD
- Emphysema
- Post-BD Airway Obstruction
- ???
### Slide 24
- COPD: chronic bronchitis or emphysema
- Post-BD Airway Obstruction
- COPD
- Emphysema
- Chronic Bronchitis
- Chronic Bronchitis: cough with expectorated sputum on a regular basis for 3-months per year over a 2-year period in the absence of another condition that explains the symptoms.
- Emphysema: alveolar destruction that leads to loss of elastic recoil of the lung (slower emptying), reduced gas diffusing capacity.
- - Emphysema without obstruction: ”Pre-COPD”
- COPD: Post-BD Airway Obstruction in the presence of irreversible damage
### Slide 25
- Scenario 1:
- 50F with prior smoking history (15 years) presents to clinic with shortness of breath limiting her exertion. PFTs show post-BD obstruction on PFTs. There is a positive BD response.
- What data can you gather to tell if the patient has COPD or Asthma?
### Slide 26
- Scenario 1:
- Comorbidities (eczema, allergic rhinitis, EoE/GERD)
- Presence (or absence) of detectable emphysema
- DLCO (often high in asthma, low in COPD)
- Day-to-day variation (esp with exposures)
- BD-response (10%+) or not has NO ROLE IN DIAGNOSING COPD OR ASTHMA
- Not predictive of COPD vs Asthma
- Does portend worse trajectory
### Slide 27
- Scenario 1:
- 65M current smoker presents w 7d of worsening shortness of breath and productive cough. No prior PFTs. Is this an acute exacerbation of COPD?
- In patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure…
