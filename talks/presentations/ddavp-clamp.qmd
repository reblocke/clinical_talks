## Slide outline
### Slide 1
- Hyponatremia 501: DDAVP CLAMP
- Brian Locke, MD
### Slide 2
- Roadmap
- Why is the clamp helpful?
- When should you clamp?
- How should you clamp?
- Does anything matter?
### Slide 3
- Two ways to get hyponatremic
- Homeostasis Overwhelmed
- Anti-Diuretic Hormone
- Appropriate response, but insufficient.
- Kidney causes water retention
- Too much free water to handle
- Carbs, Fat, EtOH → CO2+H2O
- Frail Kidneys
- ADH (vasopressin) being used as an endogenous pressor
- ADH inappropriately there
- Low Urine Osm / spec grav
- How low the urine osm & UOP differentiates
- High Urine Osm / spec grav
- Urine Na differentiates
### Slide 4
- Homeostasis Overwhelmed
- 60 kg person with an average diet: 600 mOsm/d solute.
- Healthy individual:
- max urine osm 1200 mOsm/L → L/d of urine?
- min urine osm 50 mOsm/L → L/d of urine?
### Slide 5
- Homeostasis Overwhelmed
- 60 kg person with an average diet: 600 mOsm/d solute.
- Healthy individual:
- max urine osm 1200 mOsm/L → 0.5 L/d of urine (~ 50cc/hr, coincidence?)
- min urine osm 50 mOsm/L → 12 L/d of urine? (~500cc/hr)
- more than 12L of daily intake? hyponatremia
- What is the maximum intake if:
- Minimum urine osm increases to 100? 200? 400?
- Solute intake doubles? Solute intake halves?
- Minimum urine osm increases to 100 & 2x solute intake? 100 & ½?
- GFR is too low to make 12L of urine? (AKI, CKD/Old age)
- What happens when we give ADH
- What happens when in ICU (NS…)
### Slide 6
- Body using ADH as a Vasopressor
- Inappropriate ADH
- Kidneys trying, but overwhelmed
- Urine Osm, Urine Na describe a physiologic state, not a diagnosis.
- Physiologic states change
- Repeat labs if you need to
### Slide 7
- What happens when they get NS in the ED?
- If ADH is present, urine output will be low and urine will be concentrated.
- Very little free water is excreted, serum Na won’t rise.
- If ADH is absent, urine output will be high (if GFR is) and urine will be dilute.
- Lots of dilute urine serum sodium rises.
- Unless using hypertonic, this is the ONLY way Na rapidly corrects.
- Homeostatic Overload
- Inappropriate ADH
- ADH as Vasopressor
- GFR OK and kidneys work very brisk UOP, rapid rise
- [ADH was never present]
- ADH present before and after little UOP or raise in Na
- If body no longer needs ADH as pressor turns off, brisk UOP and Na rise.
- [Cardiorenal+Hepatorenal ADH remains on]
### Slide 8
- Flip the Script
- A patient comes in with a Na of 120 and receives 1L of NS. What’s on the DDx if:
- UOP 300/hr
- Na rockets up
- UOP 50/hr
- Na jumps by 5
- Na doesn’t change
- Na drops
- Options:
- Polydipsia
- Tea & Toast / Beer Potomania
- Kidneys that don’t work good
- Cardiorenal
- Hepatorenal
- Hypovolemia
- SIADH
### Slide 9
- Flip the Script
- A patient comes in with a Na of 120 and receives 1L of NS. What’s on the DDx if:
- UOP 300/hr
- Na rockets up
- UOP 50/hr
- Na jumps by 5
- Na doesn’t change
- Na drops
- Polydipsia
- Tea & Toast / Beer Potomania
- Hypovolemia [adh turned off]
- Kidneys don’t work good (+/- any of left column0
- ADH still present:
- SIADH (min uosm ~300)
- Cardiorenal
- Hepatorenal
- [hypovol insufficient]
- SIADH
- Options:
- Tea & Toast / Beer Potomania Kidneys that don’t work good
- Hypovolemia
### Slide 10
- Revisiting SIADH treatment
- Less ADH low min osm. More ADH higher min osm.
- What is the maximum intake if (normal 12L max, 50 mOsm min urine osm):
- Minimum urine osm increases to 100? 200? 400?
- 6L, 3L, 1.5L
- Solute intake doubles? Solute intake halves?
- 2x (24L), 1/2x (6L)
- What are the two ways to treat SIADH?
### Slide 11
- Giving DDAVP (ADH)
- Why?
- To cause SIADH can’t overcorrect.
- Then treat SIADH by either fluid restricting, giving solute, or both.
- ALL the risk of over-correction comes from solute being given when ADH is low ( body can now dump free water at Uosm 50 osm/L)
- Adrogue-Madias equation: 1L NS in 70kg w/ Na 105 -> 107.5
- Overcorrection can only occur with brisk UOP (or crazy HS)
### Slide 12
- Case 1:
- Dx is psychogenic polydipsia. 15L/d. Na 120.
- Is ADH high or low? (urine osm)
- UOP is high or low before we act?
- What would happen if you gave NS?
- UOP: Serum Na:
- What would happen if you gave DDAVP + NS/HS?
### Slide 13
- Case 2:
- Profoundly dehydrated. Na 120.
- Is ADH high or low? (urine osm)
- UOP is high or low before we act?
- What would happen if you gave NS?
- UOP: Serum Na:
- What would happen if you gave DDAVP + NS/HS?
### Slide 14
- Case 3:
- CHF and cardiorenal synd. Na 120.
- Is ADH high or low? (urine osm)
- UOP is high or low before we act?
- What would happen if you gave NS?
- UOP: Serum Na:
- What would happen if you gave DDAVP + NS/HS?
### Slide 15
- When to clamp
- When to Consider the Clamp
- When it doesn’t matter (so probably don’t)
- When not to clamp
- Situations where ADH is off or going to turn off:
- Polydipsia
- Tea and Toast / Beer Potomania
- Hypovolemia or correctable ↓EABV
- SIADH (makes no physiologic difference because they’re already ‘clamped’)
- Hepatorenal (they’re clamped and it’ll be hard to fix)
- Low GFR (won’t overcorrect anyway)
- Cardiorenal (it will get in the way of decongesting)
- 2 options for when ADH is off:
- Limit solute, give back D5W to match the urine output
- Give ADH back
### Slide 16
- 2 paths when ADH turns off: commit to one
- Without DDAVP Clamp
- With DDAVP Clamp
- Very strict control of solute
- Absolutely needs monitoring of UOP (foley)
- Purpose; assess needed reaction to kidney
- If managing based on labs, always 4-6h behind
- Control of solute is less important
- Monitoring UOP is less critical
- Purpose: ensure your intervention is working
- May be appropriate for milder hyponatremia and lower potential for over-correction (low GFR, inability to fully suppress ADH)
- More appropriate for severe hyponatremia without hypervolemia, high potential for over-correction (high GFR, ability to fully suppress ADH)
- Using a “reactive” DDAVP strategy (give DDAVP as needed for over-correction) retains the worst aspects of the standard management.
### Slide 17
- How to DDAVP clamp:
- DDAVP 2 mcg IV q8hr, continued until Na at target
- Give 3% Saline to increase
- Do nothing to keep unchanged
- Give D5w to decrease
### Slide 18
- Hyponatremia Pitfalls
- Fixating on the diagnosis, not the physiologic state
- Using ”reactive” DDAVP
- Not paying attention to the UOP to tell when ADH turned off
- Not paying attention to their solute inputs (esp if not clamping)
### Slide 19
- Has there been a change?
- https://reblocke.github.io/sodiumchange/
### Slide 20
- Does anything matter? 2 recent studies:
- EHRs of 5 Toronto Hospitals
- Inclusion: Inpt, 1st Na <130. 2010—2020. N22858
- Exposure: Na, Comorbs, Corr.
- Outcome: ODS on imaging [flag then review] or ICD for ODS.
- Results: Mean Na 125. 17.7% over-corrected
- 30% got CT, 6.6% got MRI
- Devastating+Rare Hard to know
### Slide 21
- Does anything matter? 2 recent studies:
- EHRs of BWH+MGH 1993-2018
- Inclusion: Inpt, 1st Na <120. N3274
- Exposure: Na, Comorbs, Corr.
- Outcome: CPM (NLP of MRI report), LOS, Mortality
- Results: Mean Na 116.
- Where did correction → CPM come from?
### Slide 22
- Hyponatremia: summary
- It is possible we are entirely mistaken about the cause of CPM / ODS
- We know very little for certain, other than it is rare.
- Standard of care, for now, is slow correction.
- Probably net positive consequence to abandon this if slow corr causing harm
- Tools for residents: Serum Osm, Urine Osm, Urine Na
- Tools for fellows: UOP, response to solutes, clinical circumstance, cycling the labs prn
- Reactive managementOK if mild, limited GFR/ADH suppression, Hypervolemia
- Otherwise, commit to DDAVP + Hypertonic saline proactively
