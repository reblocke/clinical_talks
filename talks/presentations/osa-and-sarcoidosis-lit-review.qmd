- SARCOIDOSAS study; Italy. Sarcoidosis clinic, dx by ATS criteria.
- 122 surveys, 84 responded, 68 included.
- 8 AHI < 5; 25 AHI 5-15; 35 AHI > 15; 35 treated, 18 lost or declined. 20 treated for 3 months then reassessed. 50% mod-severe OSA
- Elevated fatigue (extreme in ¼). Male gender, BMI, and Higher Scadding stage associated with increase risk. Scadding stage (lung parenchymal involvement also correlates with severity of OSA); fatigue wasn’t.

## Slide outline
### Slide 1
- OSA and Sarcoidosis
### Slide 2
- (Sarcoidosis Vasc Diffuse Lung Dis 2020; 37 (2): 169-178) Mari
- SARCOIDOSAS study; Italy. Sarcoidosis clinic, dx by ATS criteria.
- 122 surveys, 84 responded, 68 included.
- 8 AHI < 5; 25 AHI 5-15; 35 AHI > 15; 35 treated, 18 lost or declined. 20 treated for 3 months then reassessed. 50% mod-severe OSA
- Elevated fatigue (extreme in ¼). Male gender, BMI, and Higher Scadding stage associated with increase risk. Scadding stage (lung parenchymal involvement also correlates with severity of OSA); fatigue wasn’t.
- Implication: fatigue is common in sarcoidosis, but is not entirely explained by OSA.
- Similarly, ESS can be caused by sarcoidosis outside of OSA?
- AHI didn’t predict baseline symptoms well.
- CPAP improved symptoms (though minority had elevated ESS at baseline). Single arm. High exclusion rate.
- Both fatigue and ESS improved – however, with 1 group it’s not possible to know how much this is regression to the mean.
### Slide 3
- https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2018.03.021
- Prospective, longitudinal. Sarcoidosis Jan 2010 – Dec 2015 at UCSF; N84 vs 30 controls.
- High rate (the majority) of sleep complaints (vs few in matched controls) and sleep disordered breathing - not associated with scadding score of PFTs
- No association with prednisone
- No routine screening for OSA
### Slide 4
- Lal C, Medarov BI, Judson MA. Interrelationship between sleep disordered breathing and sarcoidosis. Chest. 2015;148(4):1105–1114. doi:10.1378/chest.15–0584
- epidemiology: propose that sarcoid neuropathy, obesity due to steroids, upper airway resistance from airway involvement could contribute.
- In addition, sarcoidosis of the upper respiratory tract (SURT) 8 may result in an increase in upper airways resistance, leading to OSA or related SDB syndromes. 9 (lupus pernio may be associated with this)
- Fatigue present in 60% of patients with OSA (15), also in 60%ish patients with sarcoidosis (16). Vs EDS (can be caused by sarcoidosis – citation 6)
- Sarcoidosis can cause pulmonary hypertension, and thus additive effects on the pulmonary vasculature are suspected and lead providers to treat even mild cases to avoid the risk. [ cite this article] PH occurs in 5-20% of sarcoidosis population (more if severe).
- Not known if the inflammation from OSA influences sarcoid disease activity [cite this article]
### Slide 5
- 14. Bingol Z, Pihtili A, Gulbaran Z, Kiyan E. Relationship between parenchymalinvolvement and obstructive sleep apnea in subjects withsarcoidosis. Clin Respir J. 2015;9(1):14–21. doi:10.1111/crj.12098
- higher Ahi if lung involvement.
- 29 patients with sarcoidosis, 15 w lung involve vs 14 w/o. OSA prevalence 51.7%, more AHI and lower SaO2 in parenchymal group.
- How selected?
### Slide 6
- Respiration 2017;94:186-197https://doi.org/10.1159/000477352
- Germany, 2009 – survey distributed to members a patient group
- 1197 sarcoidosis patients: Sleepiness (ESS), Fatigue (FAS)
- Severe Fatigue 16%; Severe sleepiness 16%
- EDS: OSA (OR 2.46), dyspnea, and multiorgan involvement
- Fatigue: depression, anxiety, muscle pain
### Slide 7
- https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11325-021-02513-x
- Consecutive patients tested; 70% had sarcoidosis.
- Higher in treated and treatment naïve patients; also more common in worse disease patients
### Slide 8
- 13. Turner GA, Lower EE, Corser BC, Gunther KL, Baughman RP.Sleep apnea in sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis, Vasc Diffus lung Dis Off JWASOG. 1997;14(1):61–64. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9186990.
- 83 patients with sarcoidosis, 91 control. 17% vs 3 % OSA.

## Approach
1. TODO: Outline the initial assessment or decision point.
2. TODO: Outline the next diagnostic or management step.
3. TODO: Outline follow-up or escalation criteria.

## Red flags / when to escalate
- TODO: List red flags that require urgent escalation.

## Common pitfalls
- TODO: Capture common errors or missed steps.

## References
TODO: Add landmark references or guideline citations.
