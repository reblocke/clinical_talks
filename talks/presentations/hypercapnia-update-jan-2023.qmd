draft: true

## Summary
- Hypercapnia Research GroupJan 6 Meeting
- Goal of project
- Hypothesis 2: We can construct methods that select a more representative sample of patients (would require expanded data)
- Hypothesis 3: validate how well hypercapnia definitions that can be based on features that can be created from other datasets (e.g. NIS) would perform and whether they are usable.
- Data pre-processing
- Data sanity checking
- Admission VS (skewed center) e.g. for BMI – version w missing data?
- Inpatient medication categories
- Procedures. No TTE, EMG/NCS, PSG. No crit care time?
- Chronic conditions: Heart failure high – rest not?
- for labs e.g. ( value27441 (ABG pH) )- missing values are currently 0. They should be 7.4 (should we mean center?). Also exclude <6.5 and above 7.8
- TODO: still need to sanity check acute diagnoses.

## Slide outline
### Slide 1
- Hypercapnia Research GroupJan 6 Meeting
### Slide 2
- Goal of project
- Hypothesis 1: Commonly used methods of identifying hypercapnia identify different patients, and those patients differ in ways expected to influence prognosis and distribution of effect modifiers to treatments.
- Question: how best to demonstrate this difference?
- Principal Components are Hard to Understand
- Stratification by a few key covarites (e.g. age, gender) by frequency of causative diagnoses. (or other features too?)
-  idea, this improved stratification might allow better ‘conditional’ estimates knowing a patients comorbidities/clinical circumstance (as compared to more ‘marginal’ estimates that apply to the entire population.
### Slide 3
- Hypothesis 2: We can construct methods that select a more representative sample of patients (would require expanded data)
- In some sense, the fundamental problem of the research endeavor is that the reference standard diagnostic test (ABG) is frequently missing
- Modeling P(obtaining ABG) and P(Hypercapnia | ABG obtained) may be one avenue.
- Partial verification formulation: clinicians only seek a reference standard test in cases where some other features suggest hypercapnia is likely
- If you make certain assumptions… can you do better? IPW can extend things to work if data is assumed to be missing at random. To what extent is it?
- in order to know if that assumption is valid (enough), you’d need a gold standard reference… which would require prospective study on the population of interest (enriched population)
### Slide 4
- Hypothesis 3: validate how well hypercapnia definitions that can be based on features that can be created from other datasets (e.g. NIS) would perform and whether they are usable.
### Slide 5
- Data pre-processing
- Missing data: For hypercapnia icd codes, treatment modalities, and ABG results -> the missingness of the data is a feature of interest
- For other features: should we impute?

- [ ] --- this is true for all of the values. Physiologic bicarb 0-60. Add robustness checks
- // what is value 21600?
### Slide 12
- TODO: still need to sanity check acute diagnoses.
### Slide 13
- PCA output
- Knowing which data features are the major contributors to the principal components might guide which data elements should be included in future models?
- Is the PCA useful on its own?
- PCA: feature generation for other algorithms
- Which algorithms and for what purpose?
- K-means clustering -> what would this get us?
- Regression?
### Slide 14
- Partial verification formulation:
- ABG is reference standard, but how well can things like VBG work as imperfect standards?
- Latent class approach?
### Slide 15
- Expanded Data Set
- Target population: all patients in whom a clinician would consider that the patient has acute hypercapnic respiratory failure
- Analytic sample: widened criteria that includes both patients who had hypercapnic failure, and patients who might reasonably have been expected to. (at admission)
### Slide 16
- need robust truthfulness of data… integrity checks
- Aim: only patient admissions where all the types of data needed WOULD have been reported if they were obtained in clinical care.
- For diagnoses, only diagnosis that were known/made prior to that time.
### Slide 17
- Next steps:
- [ ] split out group membership into 3 binaries (yes/no ABG, yes/no ICD, yes/no Procedure)
- - currently too few procedure. But, that may be a function of sequential evaluation of criteria?
- [ ] version with missing data left missing (as opposed to mean) - -- how should we handle missing data?
- [ ] also a version with the “criteria” data – ie. ABG PaCO2, hypercapnia codes, and ICD for NIV included
- Problematic features: why no PSG EMG and NCS billed in the entire dataset? - restrictions on location of care?. Yet, TTE also isn't but clearly that is done inpatient frequently.
- What pre-screening can we do to improve the completeness of the sample?
- - require at least 1 result from all categories to be included?
- - eliminate iatrogenic cases... somehow?
### Slide 18
- Structure to final paper:
- Currently used methods A, B, C, and D over-selected type and underselected type compared to
- Possible features from the data that could be used to identify, or phenotype, patients include
- For research that aims to enroll a representative sample of patients to estimates the prognosis, burden to the healthcare system, or improve processes of care should consider to identify these patients.
- A future prospective study evaluating the performance of these methods is warranted.
### Slide 19
- Stratifying causes
- Also from that - could I create —> key figure of comorbidities by age in hypercapnia.
- By age? by BMI ; stratified by gender
### Slide 20
- U of U Data
- [ ] IRB and data request


## Learning objectives
- Hypercapnia Research GroupJan 6 Meeting
- Goal of project
- Hypothesis 2: We can construct methods that select a more representative sample of patients (would require expanded data)
- Hypothesis 3: validate how well hypercapnia definitions that can be based on features that can be created from other datasets (e.g. NIS) would perform and whether they are usable.
- Data pre-processing

## Bottom line / summary

- Hypothesis 3: validate how well hypercapnia definitions that can be based on features that can be created from other datasets (e.g. NIS) would perform and whether they are usable.
- Data pre-processing

## Approach
1. TODO: Outline the initial assessment or decision point.
2. TODO: Outline the next diagnostic or management step.
3. TODO: Outline follow-up or escalation criteria.

## Red flags / when to escalate
- TODO: List red flags that require urgent escalation.

## Common pitfalls
- TODO: Capture common errors or missed steps.

## References
TODO: Add landmark references or guideline citations.
