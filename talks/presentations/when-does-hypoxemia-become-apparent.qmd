## Summary
- When doe hypercapnia cause hypoxemia in SLC?
- Remember, hypercapnia in general is PaCO2 over 45 mmHg. However, at SLC elevation a PaCO2 of 42 mmHg has the same prognostic significance due to altitude induced hyperventilation.
- Standard Equation, explained
- Standard Equation, assumptions
- Extended Equation Justification
- Extended Equation, Explained
- SLC Average values
- When is hypoxemia noticeable?
- Empirical measures: Crapo et al.
- Critical PaCO2 with normal A-a gradient?

## Slide outline
### Slide 1
- When doe hypercapnia cause hypoxemia in SLC?
- Brian Locke, MD
- Pulmonary and Critical Care Fellow
### Slide 2
- Remember, hypercapnia in general is PaCO2 over 45 mmHg. However, at SLC elevation a PaCO2 of 42 mmHg has the same prognostic significance due to altitude induced hyperventilation.
- More on this later.
### Slide 3
- Standard Equation, explained
- PAO2 PiO2 – (PaCO2 / RQ)
- PiO2 represents O2 arriving at the alveoli, which becomes saturated with H2O through the airways
- PiO2 (Patm – PH2O) FiO2, PH2O taken to be 47, but varies w/ Temp
- PaCO2 / RQ represents the volume of O2 in the alveoli removed into the blood
### Slide 4
- Standard Equation, assumptions
- PAO2 (Patm – PH2O) FiO2 – (PaCO2 / RQ)
- Gases obey Dalton’s Law – Total pressure equals the sum of all the partial pressures (PAtm PN2 + PO2 + PCO2 + PH2O). Not quite true but close
- Alveolar Gases are completely saturated with water vapor. True
- CO2 in Alveoli is in equilibrium with CO2 in in pulmonary capillaries: PACO2 PaCO2. Essentially always true
- Inspired gas contains no CO2. Not quite true but close if breathing atm air
- Amount of gas inspired/utilized is equal to amount of gas expired/created by metabolism (e.g. RQ 1) – not true, but close in most circumstances.
- Addressed by complete equation on next slide
### Slide 5
- Extended Equation Justification
- PAO2 (Patm – PH2O) FiO2 – (PaCO2 / RQ)
- (Patm – PH2O) FiO2 represents O2 arriving at the alveoli, which becomes saturated with H2O through the airways
- PaCO2 / RQ represents the volume of O2 in the alveoli removed into the blood
- However: if RQ / 1, we know that every O2 molecule leaving the alveoli is NOT replaced by 1 molecule of CO2.
- E.g. RQ 0.8, VO2 might be 0.25 L/min, VCO2 might be 0.20 L/min
- Thus, at steady state – 0.05 L/min must passively diffuse into the alveoli
### Slide 6
- Extended Equation Justification
- However: if RQ / 1, we know that every O2 molecule leaving the alveoli is NOT replaced by 1 molecule of CO2.
- Vp (passive) |VO2 – VCO2|
- DOI 10.1093/bjaceaccp/mkh008
### Slide 7
- Extended Equation Justification
- However: if RQ / 1, we know that every O2 molecule leaving the alveoli is NOT replaced by 1 molecule of CO2.
- Vp (passive) |VO2 – VCO2|
- When FiO2 (1-RQ) is much less than 1, this term is small and can be safely ignored.
- DOI 10.1093/bjaceaccp/mkh008
### Slide 8
- Extended Equation, Explained
- PAO2 (Patm – PH2O) FiO2 – (PaCO2 / RQ) + FiO2 PaCO2 (1-RQ)/RQ
- (Patm – PH2O) FiO2 represents O2 arriving at the alveoli, which becomes saturated with H2O through the airways
- PaCO2 / RQ represents the volume of O2 in the alveoli removed into the blood
- FiO2 PaCO2 (1-RQ)/RQ represents the passive flow that must occur to maintain steady state when RQ / 1, because every O2 molecule leaving the alveoli is NOT replaced by 1 molecule of CO2.
### Slide 9
- SLC Average values
- PAO2 (Patm – PH2O) FiO2 – (PaCO2 / RQ) + FiO2 PaCO2 (1-RQ)/RQ
- PAO2 (650 – 47) 0.21 – (PaCO2 / 0.8) + 0.21 PaCO2 (1-0.8)/0.8
- PAO2 126.63 – (PaCO2 / 0.8) + 0.05 PaCO2
- PAO2 126.63 – 1.3 PaCO2
### Slide 10
- When is hypoxemia noticeable?
- SpO2 <90% catches people’s attention
- Corresponds to a PaO2 of ~55 mmHg (depending exactly on the individual’s oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve.
- Normal A-a gradient? 4 + (0.25 Age)
- Critical PAO2 paO2 + (A-a gradient)
- Critical PAO2 51 + 0.25 Age
### Slide 11
- Empirical measures: Crapo et al.
- PaO2 by age:
- -0.25 mmHg / yr
### Slide 12
- Critical PaCO2 with normal A-a gradient?
- Combining critical PAO2 with expected PAO2 by CO2:
- 51 + (0.25 Age) 126.63 – 1.3 PaCO2
- 75.63 - 0.25Age 1.3 PaCO2
- 58.17 - .19 Age PaCO2
- For someone who is 60?
- PaCO2 46.77 mmHg
### Slide 13
- Comparison: at sea level
- Sea level:
- PAO2 149.73 – 1.3 PaCO2
- 51 + (0.25 Age) 149.73 – 1.3 PaCO2
- 75.95 - .19 Age PaCO2
