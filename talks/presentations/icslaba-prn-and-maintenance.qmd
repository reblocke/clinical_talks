## Summary
- Update on ICS LABA for prn and long acting
- An update in case anyone missed it: albuterol in asthma is optional.
- Big updates in 2020 asthma guidelines - In case you missed it
- PRN albuterol for Asthma is on the way out.
- GINA 2020 and, to a less extent, NHLBI 2020 Update (released yesterday) both moving to ICS-LABA as PREFERRED reliever med, over albuterol.
- Why?
- -SABA use masks insufficient ICS. Increasing ICS can avert exacerbations, SABAs can't.
- -poor adherence to ICS with intermittent symptoms when separate
- -safety concerns from SABA overuse
