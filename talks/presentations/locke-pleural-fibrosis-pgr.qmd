- Can lead to Restriction / symptoms
- Asbestos-related pleural fibrosis
- Mesothelioma
- Associated with both occupational exposure and background
### Slide 15
- Pleural Plaques:
- Asbestos-related pleural plaques: high specificity when sharp, elevated opacity of the parietal pleura with a surface of several square centimeters and a thickness varying from several millimeters to 1 cm.
- 20-30 year latency
- Occur on the parietal surface, posterior rib space 6-9, sparing the costophrenic angle. Many are NOT calcified
- Asymptomatic
- Do not need to be followed: no malignant potential. However, they are a marker of increased risk
- Non-Asbestos causes of pleural plaques

### Slide 40
- How do pleural effusions cause dyspnea?
- This comes up endlessly on consults – it’s assumed that if the effusion is there and can be drained, it should be for symptomatic relief
- And particularly, how does a non-expandable lung cause dyspnea?
### Slide 41
- Pleural Effusions in General
- Gas exchange – shunting. Thora -> 18% P:F ratio improvement in ventilated patients (at 24h, more than immediate) by shunt redution. Instilling saline in pig pleura makes them hypoxemic.
- Improvement inversely correlates with pleural elastance.
- Our patient was not hypoxemic
- Mechanical: pleural drainage results in deflation of the thoracic cage, and thus improvement in lung volumes.
### Slide 42
- Pleural Effusions in General
- Gas exchange – shunting. Thora -> 18% P:F ratio improvement in ventilated patients (at 24h, more than immediate) by shunt redution. Instilling saline in pig pleura makes them hypoxemic.
- Improvement inversely correlates with pleural elastance.
- Our patient was not hypoxemic
- Mechanical: pleural drainage results in deflation of the thoracic cage, and thus improvement in lung volumes.
- Large effusions can limit CO in exercise (diastolic collapse)
- Diaphragm – flattening of diaphragm? Pendulum breathing? (would improve supine)
- Restriction (visceral pleura rind)
### Slide 43
- How does trapped lung cause dyspnea?
- Restriction
- Why did IPC not improve symptoms? “Symptomatic improvement with thoracentesis suggests efforts to reduce pleural fluid accumulation will provide continued symptomatic relief.” If it does not help.. Other causes of dyspnea should be investigated.
- )
- Adhesion of the parietal and diaphragmatic pleura in the zone of apposition of the diaphragm to the chest wall could restrict the ability of the diaphragm to shorten, and could, by limiting separation of the diaphragm and lower rib cage, limit the ability of the rib cage to expand
- “trapped lung”: trapped lung do not have symptoms referable to the pleural effusion, although some patients complain of shortness of breath due to a restrictive ventilatory defect
