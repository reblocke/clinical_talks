## Slide outline
### Slide 1
- Brian Locke R.I.P. May/2022
### Slide 2
- Overall research hypotheses:
- Surprisingly little is known about the epidemiology Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure
- Yet, the limited evidence suggests high morbidity and mortality
- Broad “syndrome” definitions are most useful for improving processes of care, yet no effective processes of care exist for hypercapnic respiratory failure.
- ’Surviving Sepsis’, LTVV, GDMT, etc….
- There is an unmet need to understand:
- Who these patients are, what is the personal/societal burden, who should be studied for management strategies.
### Slide 3
- How common are admissions with hypercapnia?
- New in 2022: Liverpool AUS, 1 regional hospital services the district
- Identified by initial ABG (w/n 24h) PaCO2 over 45, excluded iatrogenic causes/sedation. N891 people, 1135 blood gasses (repeat hosp.)
- Normalized rates of hypercapnia to population demographics
- 150 per 100,000 person/year, Acidosis in 55%.
- Compared to Age 45-54:
- RR 55-64: 2.1
- RR 65-74: 6.2
- RR 75-84: 15.7

### Slide 8
- Common Methods of Identifying Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure Produce Meaningfully Different CohortsBrian Locke, Krishna Sundar, Jeanette Brown, Ramikiran Gouripeddi
- Hypothesis 1: The methods used in prior studies of hypercapnic respiratory failure (billing code-, procedural code-, and blood-gas-based criteria) identify different patients.
- Outcome: Relative Sensitivity; Positive Predictive Agreement
- Hypothesis 2: The cohorts created by these differ methods differ in risk for outcomes of interest, which hampers interpretation of these studies.
- Outcome: distribution of age, ethnicity, BMI, and frequency of coexisting diagnoses (OSA, opiate use disorder, COPD, CHF, and neuromuscular disease)
- 69 Million MRNs aggregated from 50 academic medical centers
- Deidentified patient level data, including admissions, diagnoses, medications, procedures, and lab values.
- Missing data?

### Slide 12
- Computable Phenotype
- How should we identify patients for these studies?
- Pretest Information Post-test confidence
- Definition: electronic cohort definition for enrolling patients
- Can use machine learning or other complex algorithms
- Or, can be human understandable (understandable, trustable, generalizable)
- Hypothetical example
- Include if any of the following
- Exclude if any of the following
- First ABG PaCO2 > 45 mmHg
- Receiving IMV prior to blood gas
- Serum HCO3 over 27 and BMI over 35
- Within 3 hours of anesthesia
- ICD code for hypercapnic RF
- ICD code for any resp failure, VBG with PaCO2 > 50 and SO2 over 50%
- Etc..
### Slide 13
- Study design:
- IRB approved
- Request EDW data on all patients admitted (2015- ) meeting any of the following enrichment criteria:
- Diagnostic code for respiratory failure
- Blood gas obtained during admission
- Procedure code for starting non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation or CPAP
- BMI over 30 & HCO3 over 25?
### Slide 14
- Study design:
- Random sample of charts: in each category
- Review by 2 raters (inter-rater agreement)
- Reference “Silver Standard”
- Classification:
- Definite non-iatrogenic hypercapnic respiratory failure
- Probable iatrogenic hypercapnic respiratory failure
- Probable non-iatrogenic hypercapnic respiratory failure
- Uncertain hypercapnic respiratory failure
- Hypercapnic respiratory failure excluded
### Slide 15
- Study design:
- Calculate Se and Sp for Definite and Probable non-iatrogenic hypercapnic respiratory failure with various definitions
- # of charts? Est 300 UU patients/month in Venn
- -- 15,000 population, 95% CI, 5% margin and 10% expected proportion with ‘true’ hypercapnia
- 120 charts to review.
- Generalizability: Regenerate venn-diagram on TriNetX data (nationally representative data)
- Implication: if patterns of overlap similar, accuracy may be too
### Slide 16
- Caveats:
- Will inter-rater agreement be sufficient?
- Do we know what the concept should mean?
- Is “Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure” too heterogenous to study?
- Studying ’syndromes’ haven’t been particularly fruitful
- Intended use: enroll in studies
- Not: Best-practice alert to consider hypercapnia in an individual patient
- Is UT generalizable to everywhere else?
- What ‘features’ should we use to generate the rules?
- Age? (analogy: Age-adjusted D-dimer, similar epidemiology)
- [HCO3-]? …
### Slide 17
- Changes in Bicarbonate in Patients at Risk for Obesity Hypoventilation Undergoing Bariatric SurgeryBrian Locke, Conrad Addison, Somya Mishra, Krishna Sundar
### Slide 18
- Pooled-analysis of 5 studies (n335 w/ OHS, n1037 eucapnic obese)
- Serum HCO3 > 27 mEq/L: +LR 3.74; -LR 0.18
### Slide 19
- “In acclimatized people, the decrease in [HCO3-] is 1.5 mEq/L per each 1000 m”
- Change in variance?
### Slide 20
- Changes in Bicarbonate in Patients at Risk for Obesity Hypoventilation Undergoing Bariatric SurgeryBrian Locke, Conrad Addison, Somya Mishra, Krishna Sundar
- ERS 2018: Obesity-related hypoventilation paradigm
### Slide 21
- Changes in Bicarbonate in Patients at Risk for Obesity Hypoventilation Undergoing Bariatric SurgeryBrian Locke, Conrad Addison, Somya Mishra, Krishna Sundar
- Hypothesis 1: [HCO3-] has low enough biologic variation to functional usable surrogate for nocturnal CO2 retention peri-bariatric surgery
- Outcome: intra-patient variability in measurement, frequency of metabolic disturbances
- Hypothesis 2: Δ[HCO3-] has construct validity as an index of response to interventions that decrease nocturnal CO2 loading
- Δ[HCO3-] will be higher in patients who lose more weight, or who adhere to CPAP.
### Slide 22
- Methods
- Retrospective Cohort
- Patients: Adult patients undergoing bariatric surgery at U of Utah (2011-2016): n358 had surgery, n122 included Exclusions:
- n167 no testing or adherence data at our institution; 1 w/ AHI < 5
- n68 (36%) meds influencing acid-base; 6 on multiple:
- n15 on chronic opiates
- n26 on loop diuretic
- n22 on topiramate
- Data: extracted from EHR. Evaluated at pre-op, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60-mo post-op
- Key exposure (time-varying): Weight (Excess Body Weight Lost; IBW BMI 22)
- Key exposure (time-invariant): average PAP adherence taken from available remote-tracking flowsheets.
- Outcome: Serum [HCO3-]

- Intraclass Correlation Coefficient % of variability explained by who is getting the blood draw (allowing for linear trend): 0.37 (95% CI 0.28-0.47)
### Slide 25
- Hypothesis 2: Δ[HCO3-] will be higher in patients who lose more weight or who adhere to CPAP.
### Slide 26
- Hypothesis 2: Δ[HCO3-] will be higher in patients who lose more weight or who adhere to CPAP.
### Slide 27
- Hypothesis 2: Δ[HCO3-] will be higher in patients who lose more weight or who adhere to CPAP.
### Slide 28
- Problem: Regression to the mean
- 3 Ways to address:
- Control group
- Multiple baseline measurements
- Use ANCOVA (aka linear regression) with baseline [HCO3-] as a predictor
- where is the correlation between X and Y (0.31). How we use this depends on what data we have and how reliably we can estimate the elements of the equation.
### Slide 29
- Linear mixed(—effect) modeling
- Regression: take some input variables→ predict an outcome ([HCO3-])
- Idea: Use if data is clustered (repeat measures on the same person, each person belongs to a group, etc.)
- Regression prediction has an error compared to observed (‘residual’) – break that down into: how far the person is (on avg) away from the sample mean, and how abnormal the individual measurement is from the persons average. What you get:
- The influence of each of the predictors, accounting for the grouping.
- Repeated measures of same person are not independent (ICC: 0.37)
- Inter-
- Intra-
### Slide 30
- Linear mixed model Inputs:Baseline [HCO3-], Age, Gender, %Nights w/ PAP use, Diagnostic AHI, Excess Body Weight LossMissing data: multiple Imputation with chained equationsInteractions between AgeGender (menopause), Diag AHICPAP Use, HCO3- dichotomized: no effect.

### Slide 31
- Hypothesis 2: Δ[HCO3-] will be higher in patients who lose more weight or who adhere to CPAP.
- No. Why not?
- Not very much OHS in our group
- Elevation? Even with generous correction of 27 → 25 mEq/L (0.55-1.5 mEq/L per 3281 ft above sea level)
- Mostly pre-menopausal females; Progesterone protective?
- Some already optimized on PAP prior to enrollment? (wouldn’t influence non-adherers)
- Competing metabolic acid-base disturbances?
- Need stratification by type of weight loss surgery (some chart review)
- Maybe the ERS framework is not accurate?
- ERS Classification of OHS:
- At risk
- No Δ V̇
- No Δ
- Stage 1
- Night ↓V̇
- Stage 2
- ↑HCO3-
- Stage 3
- Day↓V̇
- ↑PaCO2
- Stage 4
### Slide 32
- Summary and Next Steps
- Barriers to HCO3- usability to track hypoventilation peri-bariatric surgery:
- ~1/4 to 1/3 on meds expected to interfere with relationship.
- Significant variability between measurement of same person.
- Did not follow expected trends in improvement among a young, mostly female cohort at altitude with minimal compensatory alkalosis.
- Stratify by surgery
- Venue? Letter to editor?
### Slide 33
- Implications for broader research aims?
- HCO3- by type of hypercapnic respiratory failure?
- Pattern of CO2 loading may differ.
- HCO3- may not be as good in acutely decompensated respiratory failure (compared to stably diagnosed OHS)
### Slide 34
- Useful References
- TriNetX / EMR Phenotype
- Bicarbonate in Bariatric Surgery
### Slide 35
- Challenges to this work:
- Is hypercapnic respiratory failure a useful ‘syndrome’ epidemiologically?
- It clearly is important diagnostically
- Are different causes of hypercapnic respiratory failure more similar, or less?
### Slide 36
- Possible next steps:
- Is hypercapnic respiratory failure becoming more common?
- What are the most common causes of hypercapnic respiratory failure?
- Possible study design:
- What proportion of hypercapnia include OSA as a contributing cause?
- Does ambient air pollution increase the risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure
- Can you extract clinically salient aspects of hypercapnic respiratory failure – can’t breathe won’t breathe – from the chart.
- Subphenotyping: best when supported by plausible mechanisms.
