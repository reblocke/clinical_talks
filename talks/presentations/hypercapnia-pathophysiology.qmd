## Slide outline
### Slide 1
- Pathophysiology of Hypercapnia
- Brian Locke, MD
### Slide 2
- CO2: Exhaust of Metabolism
- Aerobic respiration:
- carbohydrates: C6H12O6 + 6 O2 → 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + 38 ATP
- RER: VCO2/VO2 6 / 6 1
- Fat (palmitic acid): C16H32O2 + 23 O2 → 16 CO2 + 16 H2O + 129 ATP
- RER: VCO2/VO2 16 / 23 ~0.7
- Glycolysis:
- Glucose + 2[NAD+] + 2[ADP] + 2[Pi] → 2 Pyruvate + 2[NADH] + 2H+ + 2[ATP] + 2H2O
- H+ accumulates, H+ + HCO3 → H2CO3 → H2O + CO2
- RER: VCO2/VO2 1 / 0 ∞, combined with aerobic respiration RER increases.
### Slide 3
- Why is PaCO2 so tightly controlled?
- What is a normal PaCO2? 95% of ‘normals‘ fall within this range
- Sea level: 38.3 mmHg, 2 SD (95% CI) +/- 7.5 mmHg. ULN 45 mmHg
- Elevation (4500 ft): 33.5 mmHg, 42 mmHg is ULN
- Consider: during exercise there is no change in PaCO2 across a very wide range of VCO2
- The PaCO2 value is kept with 3 mmHg throughout the Day (Nunn’s) except for transient elevations up to 10 mmHg during REM sleep.
- The expected PaO2 declines with age (roughly 0.24 mmHg/year), PaCO2 does not change.
### Slide 4
- There is no apparent harm from transient CO2 elevation
- Respiratory failure: defined as failure to maintain normal arterial blood gas partial pressures.
### Slide 5
- CO2 Kinetics
- VA K VCO2 / PaCO2
- Alveolar ventilation is proportional to the ratio between CO2 production and the level of CO2 in the blood.
- VA VE (1- [Vd/Vt])
- Alveolar ventilation is the minute ventilation minus the fraction of minute ventilation that does not participate in gas-exchange (aka wasted ventilation fraction, or deadspace fraction)
- PaCO2 K VCO2 / VE (1-[Vd/Vt])
### Slide 6
- Why does the body use PaCO2 35?
- ⬇️ VA K VCO2 / PaCO2 ⬆️
- The same pH can be achieved at any PaCO2 by adjusting the bicarbonate: pH 6.1 + log [ HCO3 / (0.03 pCO2) ]
- Ventilation is metabolically expensive
- work of breathing 2% of O2 at rest
- increases hugely with exercise or pathology
- Why doesn’t the body operate with with a PaCO2 of 70? (and an HCO3 of 44 pH 7.42)
- Davenport Diagram; visualizes Henderson-Hasselbach Relationships
### Slide 7
- Why doesn’t PE cause hypercapnia?
- ⬆️ PaCO2 K VCO2 / VE (1-[Vd/Vt ⬆️])
- PaCO2 changing ALWAYS must indicate either a failure of the control system (won’t breathe), the mechanical systems response to an increase in demand or a constraint (can’t breathe), or both
- Increase in demand for VE: increase in VCO2, increased in Vd/Vt, (compensation for metabolic acidosis)
- Constraints: load on respiratory muscles or reduction in their strength
### Slide 8
- Metabolic Parabola
- If you hold VCO2 and Vd/Vt constant and plot:
- PaCO2 K VCO2 / VE (1-[Vd/Vt])
- Hypothetical move toward a new higher CO2 set-point to reduce work of breathing
- Controller Response: Hypercapnic Response to Ventilation
- Hypothetical demand from metabolic acidosis
### Slide 9
- How much demand can people handle?
- Back-of-the-envelope math with CPET normal values give a sense
- Normal 70kg, 60-year-old female VO2 at peak 1.66 L/min (24.5 mL/kg/min)
- 3.5 mL/min/kg 1 met; thus, normal capacity of 7 Mets
- Normal ventilatory reserve is 15% or more
- Thus, normal individuals can tolerate ~8.8-fold increase in VCO2 without a change in PaCO2
- Equivalent to an 89% Vd/Vt; this is why PE does not cause hypercapnia in the absence of control or mechanical system failure
- TODO: normal values for MVV?
### Slide 10
- The PCO2/Ventilation Response ‘Curve’
- Sensitivity of controller system: force an increase in PaCO2 and observe how much VE increases.
- Represented by the straight, dashed line
- Ventilation S (PCO2– B)
- S is slope (Δ VE / Δ PaCO2)
- B is the intercept at zero ventilation.
- Steeper: more sensitive. Flatter: less sensitive
- Normal range 0.5-8.0 L/min/mmHg (surprisingly wide)
- 80% of subjects have a response between 1.5 and 5 L/min/mmHg
- Controller Response: Hypercapnic Response to Ventilation
### Slide 11
- Measuring Controller Sensitivity
### Slide 12
- Breath Holds
- PaCO2 causes an irresistibly strong urge to breathe in individuals with normal respiratory systems
- on room air, typically near 50 mmHg (diaphragmatic contractions occur at PaCO2 ~46-49)
- on supplemental oxygen, can tolerate much longer (highly trained apneass can increase their conventional breakpoint to critical hypoxia, which is 20-30 mmHg O2)
- can be extended by rebreathing gas (the sensation of air hunger is partially mediated by lack of movement in / out)
### Slide 13
- Things that change controller sensitivity
- Normal Controller: A
- Opiate Controller: B (50% reduction in sensitivity)
- Note: if opiate is administered, apnea can occur due to the absence of ‘hockey stick’ portion
- Note2: PaCO2 doesn’t change all that much (7mmHg) despite decreased sensitivity (50%)

- TODO: No text extracted from this slide.
### Slide 15
- Can’t Breathe
- Brain Curve
- Ve the respiratory controller wants (if mechanical system intact)
- Ventilation Curve
- Actual Ve the mechanical system can achieve
- Dissociation of the curves is air hunger
- metabolic acidosis and hypoxemia steepens the brain curve slope
- increased VCO2 and deadspace (metabolic parabola moves up)
- Decreased compliance flattens ventilation curve
- B. Pneumonia
### Slide 16
- How well does nl a-a exchange exclude obstructive lung da?
- Mechanism of paco2 - not v/q matching bc co2 dissociation is linear so over and under ventilation CAN compensate - unlike V/Q matching’s effect on hypoxemia
- Additionally, it is directly sensed and thus respiratory compensation occurs
