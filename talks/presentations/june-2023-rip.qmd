### Slide 7
- PA:AA
- PAd
### Slide 8
- 10 years of follow-up too short in young people?
### Slide 9
- Conclusions
- When comparing people of the same age/sex, both PAd and PA:AA predict a higher mortality risk
- PAd has a threshold; PA:AA is (log)linearly worse at higher ratio
- PA:AA is strongly confounded by age → young people seem to have larger PA:AA without apparent excess risk when mildly elevated
- Threshold for abnormal PA:AA should be higher in younger adults
- (Yet) Unresolved Questions:
- Is excess risk mediated by pulmonary vascular mechanisms?
- Other outcomes besides death? (ER, Hospitalization) Who gets further workup and how do they do?
- Can you use this information to target intervention? (e.g. PH referral)
- Can data be combined for better prediction?
- OR of TR Jet Vel. 2.8+ w/n 90d if PA enlarged

- Under Review: JAMA NO
### Slide 12
- Wisconsin sleep cohort
- A 10% weight loss predicted a 26% (95% CI, 18%-34%) decrease in the AHI.
- 74 RCTs. PAP improves:
- ESS
- Sleep QOL
- Overall HrQOL
- There is not evidence PAP improves:
- Mortality
- MI/CVA events
- ~70% w/ OSA are obese
- 5% (gen obese pop) lose >10%BW
- Consider pharmacologic (BMI>27) and surgical (BMI>35) weight loss options & still overweight

- Heritability of obesity: 40-70%
- Heritability of LDL levels: 22-91%
- If LDL levels were visible and having low LDL were desirable/high-status, would we have the same restriction on statins?
- Prejudice→
### Slide 14
- PubMed, Embase Ovid, and Cochrane Central
- Design: RCTs, no blinding req.
- Intervention: surgical or medical weight loss interventions
- Comparator: placebo, no treatment, or standard of care.
- Outcome: Must report percentage weight loss and AHI difference from randomization to one month or longer follow-up

### Slide 16
- 10 eligible trials (n843 patients) were included. Four (n200) assessed bariatric surgery and 6 (n643) assessed pharmacologic interventions over a median follow-up of 13 months (interquartile range 6 to 26 months).
### Slide 17
- Decrease of 0.45 (95% CI: 0.18-0.73 events/hour) events per hour for each 1% body weight loss
- Corresponds to a 1.84% AHI change (95% CI: 0.34-3.33%)

- Change in ESS
### Slide 19
- Conclusions
- Novelty: can predict how much AHI improvement to expect from anti-obesity interventions
- Prior observational data: subject to confounding by the cause of weight loss
- This data: still subject to study-level confounders (selection into study; distribution of endotypes)

### Slide 20
- Predictors of Initial CPAP Prescription and Subsequent Course in Patients with Central Sleep Apneas.
- Brian W. Locke MD, Jeffrey Sellman MD, Jonathan McFarland DO, Francisco Uribe MD, Kimberly Workman RPSGT,
- Krishna M. Sundar, MD
### Slide 21
- Causes of Central Sleep Apnea
- High loop gain from high controller gain
- High loop gain from high plant gain
- Failure of rhythm generation
- CPAP often lowers controller gain: addressing (intermittent) hypoxemia
- CPAP often lowers plant gain: improving hypercapnia
- Individual Events:
- Proportion of Events:
- Pure
- Central
- Pure Obstructive
### Slide 22
- Modeled clinicians implied prediction (independent predictors of decision to prescribe CPAP)
- Modeled independent predictors of outcomes
- Research Question: do clinicians accurately predict who will respond favorably to a trial of CPAP?
- Operationalization: are predictors of receiving (or not receiving) a trial of CPAP also the predictors of failing a trial of CPAP when it is tried?
### Slide 23
- TODO: No text extracted from this slide.
### Slide 24
- Rational decision-making when you can’t predict perfectly:
- Outcome →
- CPAP adequate if trialed
- CPAP not adequate if trialed
- Prediction ↓
- CPAP trialed
- True Positive
- False Positive
- CPAP not trialed
- False Negative
- True Negative
- ??
- Harms of the two types of errors
- “False Positive “ (trialed CPAP, didn’t work)
- “False Negative” (didn’t trial CPAP, would have worked)
- Delayed effective treatment
- Patients less likely to adhere to PAP if it has previously failed them
- More expensive
- Requires more expertise
- May be harmful in some settings (SERVE-HF)
- Optimal “threshold” (minimum predicted probability of CPAP failing where it Is still worthwhile to try) depends on how bad False Positive is relative to False negative.
- Is it plausible that the optimal threshold varies by characteristics? Yes, for some…
### Slide 25
- Other findings:
- Inverse-probability of CPAP weighting adjustment leads to no major change ( more on this later)
- However, if patients who received CPAP are different in unmeasured characteristics (HCSR, etc.) then groups aren’t validly comparable.

### Slide 26
- Conclusions:
- Providers decisions about whether to trial CPAP appear to correctly weight some features (e.g. Opiates, % CSA) but incorrectly weight others (Age, OSA-associated centrals)
- Optimal rates of CPAP trial are TBD, but nudges might offer improvements.
- Outcome assumes providers/patients continue therapy benefiting them…
- When HSAT (unexpectedly) identifies CSA, CPAP is often trialed and often effective)
- Baclofen- or Opiate-related centrals respond poorly to treatment, even when they constitute <50% events
- Perhaps should be considered CSA, even when not meeting dx criteria
### Slide 27
- Computable Phenotypes for Identifying Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure
- Brian W Locke MD, Wayne Richards MSc, Jeanette K Brown MD PhD, Ramkiran Gouripeddi MBBS MSc, Krishna M Sundar MD
- Problems with retrospective EHR-based research: Missing Data, Time/Event determination (immortal time), Observational nature (residual confounding; multiple comparisons), Disease Identification (enrollment, covariates, outcomes)
- Contrast: Prospective cohort with systematic assessment and verification of diagnostic labels… (Asthma, COPD, OHS, OSA)
- Computable phenotype: an algorithms to identify specific types of patients
- Simple: e.g. inclusion criteria to a study
- Complex: use additional data elements (demographics, meds), natural-language processing, etc.
### Slide 28
- Why not just include patients w PaCO2 > 45? (or an ICD code for hypercapnic respiratory failure?)
- ABGs are variably obtained in clinical practice: less reliable in usual care than enrollment criteria
- People who get ABGs are different from people who don’t
- Practice varies widely by setting
- Symptoms are variable, the diagnosis is missed in the majority of cases
- (Nowbar 2004; Nowalk 2023 SLEEP Abstract)
- Study Aim
- Efficacy Trial
- Determine Burden of Disease
- Improve Processes of Care
- Ideal Characteristic
- Select a population with severe disease, homogeneous in characteristic that predicts treatment responsiveness
- Capture all patients who suffer from the adverse consequences of hypercapnic respiratory failure
- Identify all patients who will benefit from instituting certain management pathways
- Example
- Severe COPD, no other cause of CO2, severe air trapping, PaCO2 > 52 mmHg
- More sensitive definition?
- (If only use PaCO2, you will miss patients and skew toward people with classic/severe presentation)
- What is the national re-admission rate?
- How common are admission with hypercapnia?
- Does PM 2.5 influence?
### Slide 29
- Needs: initial decompensation → treatment
- Presentation With Hypercapnia
- Hypercapnia is common, highly morbid, and likely increasing in frequency (obesity, opiates, multimorbidity)
- Correctly Recognized?
- Causes Correctly Diagnosed?
- Is there data to guide treatment?
- Is it logistically possible?
- Does it happen?
- Inpt Hypercapnia is frequently missed in practice
- Many patients do not receive definitive testing
- We don’t know what to do for many (most?) patients with hypercapnia
- Device qualification restrictions.
- Requires coordination between Inpt  Outpt. Consider CHF (CMS f/u after discharge)
- Marik, JICM 2012: 75% miss rate.
- Nowbar, AJM 2004
- OSA in 5-15% vs 50-80%
- No good estimate? (NMD/Rest, COPD, OHS, OVS)
- No good estimate?
### Slide 30
- Proposed framework:Sufficient vs Component Causes (Rubin)
- Obesity
- Untreated
- Sleep Apnea
- COPD
- Loop diuretic
- Opiates
- Sufficient cause: a set of factors that will cause disease when present
- End-stage COPD with hyperinflation
- Component cause: a factor that, if not present, no disease would occur
- Untreated OSA, metabolic alkalosis, chronic opiate use

- For a given encounter, the institution must have submitted some data (any data) for each of the data elements requested.
- Data validation measures:
- Positive controls: e.g if dx of Pna, expect abx Rx
- Negative controls: <BMI 30 in OHS
- True (patho)physiologic state
- What the clinician recognizes
- What the clinician documents
- What information is structured
- What data is aggregated in TriNetX

### Slide 39
- Intuition: use common data elements to accurately infer missing data elements
- May be missing because they are not tracked in the dataset
- E.g. National Inpatient Sample: ICD, procedures, and Demographics
- May be missing because they were not obtained/recorded by the clinician
- Desired Specs:
- REALLY simple: Usable by researchers (available as ShinyApp on my github). No ML
- Usable on different data-sets:
- e.g. NHIS (ICD codes & demographics only), health record data (more data elements)
- Probabilistic: Give either a categorical (v. low, low, high, v. high) or numerical prediction.
- Some tasks warrant high specificity; others high sensitivity. Allows researcher discretion

### Slide 42
- SRMA: Use of HCO3- in a outpatient sleep study center: different characteristics.
### Slide 43
- Can you combine different data-elements?
- Aim: identify hypercapnia to a certain threshold probability
- Bayes theorem:
- LR represents informativeness of a test
- (↑)Pretest (↓)LR (no 𝚫) Posttest
- Regardless of specific threshold
- To assess accuracy: need a “ground truth”: What to use when ABG not obtained?
- Many conditions: ”clinician review”, not possible nor feasible
- Proposal: Inverse probability of ABG weigting.

### Slide 49
- ‘Silver’ Standard: Inverse Probability (of ABG) Weighted PaCO2
- Intuition behind the propensity weighted ‘pseudopopulation’:
- If a patient has the finding, but was unlikely to get the test: there are probably many more out there that aren’t captured.
- It is a valid approximation to the extent that:
- Observations are independent and identically distributed 👍
- Overlap: some possibility that each patients might have/not get an ABG 👍
- Conditional independence: after account for all the covariates, there is no longer an association between the P(ABG) and P(PaCO2 > 45) 👎
- To the extent we can capture the reasons for chance variation in the propensity score, it will improve estimation of the features associated with hypercapnia (if an ABG had been checked in everyone)
### Slide 50
- LASSO Ordinal logistic regression(s)
- Problem: many possible predictors: which ones do you choose?
- Take a set of ~10-15 physio/sociologically plausible predictors
- LASSO: most parsimonious set of predictors to allow for a categorical probabilistic assessment of hypercapnia (within 24h of admission) if it were checked.
- Separate model for diagnostic codes only (expect lower discriminative ability)
- Separate model including lab values (EHR data-set)
- Very High Probability (90%+) of hypercapnic RF
- Age
- BMISex
- Dx Hypercap. RF?
- Dx Any Resp Failure?
- COPD?
- Etc..
- HCO3
- Cl-
- VBG? PCO2; pH
- ABG? PCO2; pH
- …
- (API & published regression equation)
### Slide 51
- Will it work? Validation
- Retrospective Validation in an independent data set (Acute, Chronic)
- Collaborators EHR, or MIMIC etc.
- Retrospective Validation at U of U with elevation correction
- Prospective K23 Grant Application: obtain SennTec TcCO2 (95% LOA: +/- 7mmHg) on a random sample of patients admitted and predicted to various levels of PaCO2 probability. 3 Aims Addressed
- Does the identification algorithm work?
- What happens to the hypercapnic patients? (cohort, care processes)
- How well do clinicians do at identification? (and does it matter?)
- Grant Writing Fall 2023; Aim for Feb 2024 NIH Grant Cycle
