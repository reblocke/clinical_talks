## Summary
- Non-Cognitive Predictors of Student Success:A Predictive Validity Comparison Between Domestic and International Students
- The causes, prevalence, and consequences of hypercapnic respiratory failure are not well described. EHR data could help.
- WHY? The gold-standard test (ABG showing PaCO2 > 45 mmHg) is unreliably obtained.
- WHAT HAS BEEN DONE?
- Prevalence ~ PE (150 per 100k/y)
- Readmission ≥ CHF (23%, 30d)
- Mortality ~ Cancer (~40% 1yr)
- .
- Yet, methods of identification select very different patients.
- COMPUTABLE PHENOTYPE: (operational case definition)
- - Efficacy trial: homogeneity, severity important
- - Epi; QI: sensitivity, representativeness

### Slide 1
- Non-Cognitive Predictors of Student Success:A Predictive Validity Comparison Between Domestic and International Students
- The causes, prevalence, and consequences of hypercapnic respiratory failure are not well described. EHR data could help.
- WHY? The gold-standard test (ABG showing PaCO2 > 45 mmHg) is unreliably obtained.
- WHAT HAS BEEN DONE?
- Prevalence ~ PE (150 per 100k/y)
- Readmission ≥ CHF (23%, 30d)
- Mortality ~ Cancer (~40% 1yr)
- .
- Yet, methods of identification select very different patients.
- COMPUTABLE PHENOTYPE: (operational case definition)
- - Efficacy trial: homogeneity, severity important
- - Epi; QI: sensitivity, representativeness
- WHY IS THIS WORTH DOING?
- Obesity, Opiates, Multimorbidity ↑
- Common component causes? Unknown
- Evidence: RCTs only of select subsets
- Post-acute management?
- Disorganized processes of care
- Evidence needed to improve

## Approach
1. TODO: Outline the initial assessment or decision point.
2. TODO: Outline the next diagnostic or management step.
3. TODO: Outline follow-up or escalation criteria.

## Red flags / when to escalate
- TODO: List red flags that require urgent escalation.

## Common pitfalls
- TODO: Capture common errors or missed steps.

## References
TODO: Add landmark references or guideline citations.
