### Slide 3
- Roadmap & Learning Goals
- What is hypercapnic respiratory failure?
- What guidelines say to do with hypercapnic respiratory failure?
- Goal: Understand limitations on current guidelines to the management of all-comers with hypercapnic respiratory failure.
- Who gets hypercapnic respiratory failure?
- Goal: What is known and unknown about the role of obesity and OSA
- Current Research
- How could we do it better?
### Slide 4
- Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure
- Build up here CO2 in blood rises
- Definition: Higher PaCO2 in the blood than it should be
- Cause: not enough alveolar ventilation for CO2 production
- Near synonyms:
- Ventilatory Failure
- Type 2 Respiratory Failure
- Hypoventilation
- Hypercapnia
- Except for REM sleep, our bodies keep PaCO2 within 3-5 mmHg despite huge changes in CO2 production
### Slide 5
- Causes of Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure
- Mechanisms:
- Decreased drive to breathe (OHS, Opiates)
- Increase need for ventilation (Obesity)
- Inefficient pulmonary function (Lung diseases)
- Muscle or inefficient weakness (NMD, COPD)
- Increased respiratory system loads
- Airway resistance (OSA, COPD)
- Stiff lungs or chest wall (Obesity)
- Frailty:
- Achievable ventilation ~ Acquired ventilation
- Drive to breathe is not stable / reliable
- Achievable Ventilation
- Required Ventilation
### Slide 6
- How common is outpatient hypercapnia?
- There is 0 data on prevalence of outpatient all-cause hypercapnia.
- Why? Fewer data sources, ABGs are invasive, less morbid population
- Based on low identification rates; still high NIV prescription: OHS is probably most common
- Fermi Estimate of Prevalence: 1 in 260 US adults
- 7.6% of adults US population BMI 40+
- Rate of mod+ OSA in BMI 40+ ~ 50%
- Rate of OHS in mod+ OSA ~10%
### Slide 7
- Guidelines
- Body mass index above 30 kg/m2
- Awake PaCO2 above 45 mmHg at sea level
- Exclusion of other causes of hypoventilation
### Slide 8
- COPD
- 13 RCTs; NIV vs std care
- Mortality risk: RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.27;
- Decrease in hospitalizations: mean difference, 1.26 fewer; 95% CI, 2.59 fewer to 0.08 more hospitalizations
- Improved QOL: standard MD [SMD], 0.48; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.88
- improvement in dyspnea SMD, −0.51; 95% CI, −0.95 to −0.06

- OSA excluded or CPAP tried
- 2-4 weeks recovery from exac.
- Neuromuscular Dz
- Meta-analysis of 4+3 (mixed) RCTs
- MIP < 60cmH2o or FVC < 50%
- few trials of patient important outcomes in overlap syndromes have been done.
### Slide 11
- How common are admissions with hypercapnia?
- 2022: Liverpool AUS, 1 regional hospital services the entire district
- Identified by initial ABG (w/n 24h) PaCO2 over 45, excluded iatrogenic causes/sedation. N891 people, 1135 blood gasses (repeat hosp.)
- Normalized rates of hypercapnia to population demographics
- 150 per 100,000 person/year
- Acidosis in 55%.
- For Comparison:
### Slide 12
- Support for frailty framework
- Compared to Age 45-54:
- RR 55-64: 2.1
- RR 65-74: 6.2
- RR 75-84: 15.7
- RR 85-94: 26.2
- Frailty:
- Achievable ventilation ~ Acquired ventilation
- Drive to breathe is not stable / reliable
### Slide 13
- Acute Exacerbations: guidance for inpatient management
- NIV: Well Supported
- Acute outcomes are very good
- What we do after the inpatient admission is the unresolved question.
- More subsequent data supporting these indications
### Slide 14
- Post-exacerbation Management: OHS
- 30-70% of cases are diagnosed during an acute exacerbation (ERS)
### Slide 15
- No RCTs have addressed this question
- 10 observational studies (3 studies of hospitalized cohorts, 6 with hospitalized subgroups); serious risk of bias.
- “After adjusting for age, sex, and baseline PaCO2, the odds ratios (ORs) for [90-day] mortality were significantly lower in the group discharged on PAP (adjusted OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.08–0.33)”
### Slide 16
- TODO: No text extracted from this slide.
### Slide 17
- Inpatient Diagnostic Pathway for S.D.B. w Hypoventilation
- “Because arterial blood gas (ABG) was not available on all patients, we utilized a broad definition of hypoventilation defined as ABG during index admission with partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) ≥ 45 mmHg or end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2)/transcutaneous CO2 (TCCO2) during PSG ≥ 50 mmHg for at least 10 minutes”; inpatient sleep study requested by medicine team or pulm/cards consult.
- Retrospective Review
- Most frequently OHS or HFpEF
- Admitted with CHF exac, COPD exac, or other
- 90-day readmission was 19.5% in patients who were adherent to PAP therapy vs 55.5% in nonadherent patients (a 65% reduction). 20 of 45 (44.4%) excluded patients with hypoventilation had 90-day readmission.
- Minimal matching and control for healthy adherer bias
### Slide 18
- Do NOT start at hospitalization
- wait 2-4 weeks to see if acute on chronic becomes chronic.
- In-lab titration PSG not recommended for pure-COPD; attempt to normalize daytime pCO2.
- AVAPS not better than PS
### Slide 19
- Post-AECOPD trials
- Mode: BPAPS/T
- Driving pressure
- Timing of start after acute exacerbation
- RESCUE vs HOT-HMV
- (Not Post Exacerbation)

- Assessment
- 2
- Assessment 3
- Common: COPD
- Common: OHS
- PaCO2 at discharge (not HCO3), Severity classification are associated with persistence (DOI: 10.1159/000524845)
- High PaCO2 and Prior Acute NIV predict recurrence (DOI: 10.1111/resp.12652)
### Slide 21
- Timing of NIV: COPD vs OHS
- “Guidelines for chronic hypercapnic COPD recommend a 2- to 4-week recovery period following hospitalization for COPD exacerbation before assessing for noninvasive ventilation to confirm that chronic hypercapnia is persistent (eg, PaCO2 ≥ 52 mm Hg)”
- This recommendation is derived from the fact that 21% of patients with COPD recruited for the Home Oxygen Therapy-Home Mechanical Ventilation (HOT-HMV) trial were excluded because the hypercapnia on discharge resolved after 2 to 4 weeks.
- Conversely, the guidelines for OHS suggest hospitalized patients with OHS be continued on PAP therapy following hospital discharge until they undergo polysomnography, ideally within the first 3 months of discharge.6
- This recommendation is driven by a mortality difference at 3 months postdischarge between patients with OHS discharged without PAP (16.8%) and with PAP (2.3%).14

- ATS COPD NIV Guideline (2020): 17,960 (15%)
- Neither guideline: 61%
### Slide 37
- Limitations and next steps
- All single-encounter data due to data quality
- Will look at intubation and NIV inpt rates; hopefully LOS
- Can’t evaluate readmissions, mortality, outpatient management.
- Data quality: contingent on local practices (hard to assess)
- Next Steps
- Will evaluate how cohort definitions differ (last year’s Sleep GR)
- Will characterize patients using clustering: ?identify useful endotypes
- Request expanded data-set including patients without hypercapnia to evaluate features that correlate with presence of hypercapnia.
### Slide 38
- Roadmap & Learning Goals
- What is hypercapnic respiratory failure?
- What guidelines say to do with hypercapnic respiratory failure?
- Goal: Understand limitations on current guidelines to the management of all-comers with hypercapnic respiratory failure.
- Who gets hypercapnic respiratory failure?
- Goal: What is known and unknown about the role of obesity and OSA
- Current Research
- How could we do it better?
### Slide 39
- All-comers with Decompensated Hypercapnia?
- “For non-COPD patients recovering from an episode of AHRF, a referral to a home ventilation service for assessment of ‘domiciliary NIV use’ has been recommended, while continuing ‘nocturnal NIV’ till to the accomplishment of the evaluation.
- “Good practice point”, not recommendation based on empiric data
- What about other management strategies? (Acetazolamide, vascular congestion management, pulmonary rehab… )
### Slide 40
- Medicare Nationwide Readmissions Database 2010-2016: 1.6 million COPD admissions
- 71% of readmission risk from obesity was attributable to OSA.
- Critique: correlative methods, no severity
### Slide 41
- Resmed & Inovalon Insights, LLC payor claims database: 6810 pts with a COPD diagnostic code in the year before device set up
- Matching: sex, comorbidities, COPD-related HC usage in prior year
- Propensity score for CPAP adherence
- Outcomes: ↓ER Visit and Hospitalizations
- Critique: healthy adherer bias
### Slide 42
- N32 RCT: BPAP-S vs CPAP
- Patients: OSA (AHI 59), BMI (43), PAP Naïve, No NMD, and COPD/Obst (FEV1 48% pred)
- 80% Power to detect 𝚫7 mmHg PaCO2 at 3 months
- Avg 15.8/9.7 BPAP; 12.7 CPAP
- Better spiro and SF-36 cog in BPAP group, but not powered for that
### Slide 43
- What do we do about the multiple component cause folks?
- Generalize? But does this work?
- “This patient is mostly OHS”  BiPAP or CPAP immediately
- “This patient is mostly COPD”  wait 2-4 weeks before NIV
- “Off-label”: can do for medications
- Payors? They want evidence to pay for machines
### Slide 44
- Leaky Pipeline from admission to treatment
- Presentation With Hypercapnia
- Hypercapnia is common, highly morbid, and likely increasing in frequency
- Correctly Recognized?
- Causes Correctly Diagnosed?
- Is there data to guide treatment?
- Is it logistically possible?
- Does it happen?
- Inpt Hypercapnia is frequently missed in practice
- Many patients do not receive definitive testing
- We don’t know what to do for many (most?) patients with hypercapnia
- Device qualification restrictions.
- Requires coordination between Inpt  Outpt. Consider CHF (CMS f/u after discharge)
- Marik, JICM 2012: 75% error rate.
- SDB: 30% vs 60-75%
- No good estimate
### Slide 45
- What is ‘hypercapnic respiratory failure’?
- Problems with PaCO2 > 45 mmHg (sea-level, current def)
- 97.5 Percentile of ‘normal’?
- “Hypercapnic respiratory failure is a syndrome”
- Syndrome (Greek: ‘con-currence’) a set of signs and symptoms that together suggest a common cause.
- Yet PaCO2 Lab finding (hypercapnia). Gap?
- If there is no agreed-upon reference standard test: perhaps ‘construct’ is a better term.
- 2 instrumental uses:
- Classification: e.g. “Hyperlipidemia”
- Prediction: “10-y ASCVD risk”
- Ideal Definition:
- Who is at risk for future/ongoing ventilatory failure?
- Who will respond to treatments?
### Slide 46
- Research Aims:
- Who are these patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure?
- How should we best identify patients with hypercapnia? (for study, and in practice)
- Where are the biggest gaps in management knowledge?
### Slide 47
- Roadmap & Learning Goals
- What is hypercapnic respiratory failure?
- What guidelines say to do with hypercapnic respiratory failure?
- Goal: OHS – CPAP/BPAP; ↑CO2 COPD – wait 2-4wks exac, high PIP NIV
- Goal: Unclear what to do with multifactorial-cause hypercapnia
- Who gets hypercapnic respiratory failure?
- Goal: Often multi-morbid. These patients have high utilization/mortality
- How could we do it better?
- Goal: Need better data to guide decisions
- Goal: Need better systems of care
