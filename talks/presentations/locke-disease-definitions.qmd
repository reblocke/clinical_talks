## Summary
- PGR: What’s in a definition?
- In order of progressive ambiguity
- Does it matter how we speak about it?
- The only time a test can be absolutely “pathognomic” for a disease is when it is defined as such.
- An argument for not conflating tests and diagnoses
- ”The UA shows a UTI”
- ”The CXR shows a Pna”

### Slide 6
- Does it matter how we speak about it?
- STEMI / OMI – “STEMI EQUIVALENTS”
- Prescribing antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria
- “Non-resolving pneumonia”
### Slide 7

## Approach
1. TODO: Outline the initial assessment or decision point.
2. TODO: Outline the next diagnostic or management step.
3. TODO: Outline follow-up or escalation criteria.

## Red flags / when to escalate
- TODO: List red flags that require urgent escalation.

## Common pitfalls
- TODO: Capture common errors or missed steps.

## References
TODO: Add landmark references or guideline citations.
