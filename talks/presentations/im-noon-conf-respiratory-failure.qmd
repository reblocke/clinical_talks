## Slide outline
### Slide 1
- Physiology-Based Schemas
- Brian Locke MD
- P/CCM
### Slide 2
- Acute Respiratory Failure Goals:
- Construct Schemas for how to think about 2 common situations
- [O2] The SpO2 is low and won’t come up with 6L via nasal cannula
- [CO2] This patient feels dyspneic
- [CO2] This patient is gorked and their serum [HCO3-] is 35 mmHg…. (another time)
- Focus on understanding what’s happening (treatment is easy)
### Slide 3
- Cargo Cult Thinking: two things occur together → one causes the other
- “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool.”
### Slide 4
- Hypoxemia and Dyspnea
### Slide 5
- Solution to cargo cult thinking? Try to falsify
- Still a problem, but not
- respiratory distress
### Slide 6
- Hypoxemia… is a problem though
### Slide 7
- Refractory Hypoxemia Schema
- RRT:
- SpO2 is 75%,
- 15L NRB!
### Slide 8
- Pulse Oximetry: Screening Test
- This issue is not (yet) fixed!
- Baseline Accuracy: FDA standard 95% LOA within 2-3%
- Situations where accuracy worsens:
- Hypoxemia below SaO2 80%
- Poor perfusion: hypovolemia, heart failure, vasoconstriction, sepsis
- Carbon monoxide poisoning (people who’ve smoked), sickle cell
- Non-white skin, nail polish, make-up
- Pulse Required!
- Lack of venous pulsation required!
- Translucency required!
### Slide 9
- SaO2 is low?
- Causes of hypoxemia that resolve with 6L O2
- V/Q Mismatch
- Hypoventilation
- Low FiO2, Low Barometric Pressure
- Causes of hypoxemia that don’t resolve with 6L O2
- Shunt: Blood passes from venous to arterial circulation without contacting inhaled air.
- Through the lung: opacity should be present on CXR
- Through the heart…
- In locations where congenital heart disease is identified and fixed, this generally requires systemic PA pressures
### Slide 10
- RRT 1! Hypoxemia
- 68M who is POD 2 after hip replacement.
- No DVT prophylaxis.
- Hypoxemia (~85%) develops on 6L Patient is hemodynamically stable
- Mild tachypnea ~20 breaths per minute
- You order a CXR and ABG
- Differential?
### Slide 11
- Refractory Hypoxemia Schema
- Consolidations cause shunts!
### Slide 12
- Urbach-Wiethe Disease: bilateral amygdala damage due to fat deposits.
- Patient S.M.: No conditioning to aversive stimuli, no fear in life-threatening situations, no recognition of fear in others
- 35% Inhaled CO2 challenge (↑PaCO2)
- Air hunger provoked panic attack
- First sensation of fear since childhood
- Reproduced in others with U-W Disease
- If hypoxemia doesn’t cause dyspnea… what does?
### Slide 13
- “16M fell into a ... transport wagon being filled with whole wheat grain and was immediately submersed…
- …mouth and pharynx were cleared of large amounts of packed grain
- Attempts to clear grain provoked instability
- …placed in the Trendelenburg position for central line placement, it was noted that …several grain seeds would fall […from] the ETT during expiration.
- During the subsequent 20 min, the surgeon performed manual chest percussions as the patient was moved alternately from supine to lateral and prone positions”
- Patient had no residual neurologic or respiratory signs or symptoms…
### Slide 14
- Evolution of the Control of Breathing
- Gas Composition in Water
- CO2 is 30x more soluble than O2 (low O2)
- Gil Breathers
- O2 is limiting factor, PaCO2 very low (1-4mmHg)
- → O2 determines respiratory drive in Fish/Amphibians
- Gas Composition in Air
- 21% O2, 0.04% CO2. [and both are equally ‘soluble’]
- (Proto-) Lung Breathers
- Ventilation only to ensure O2 → CO2 will be too high
- → CO2 determines respiratory drive in mammals (etc.)
### Slide 15
- Keep O2 and CO2 Problems Separate!
- O2
- CO2
- Need sufficient O2 gas tension ALWAYS
- Won’t cause damage if varies (as long as O2 available)
- Body doesn’t keep as close tabs on it as you’d think
- Brainstem is EXQUISITELY sensitive to it
- We continually screen for low O2 (pulse ox.)
- We seldom monitor (except indirectly, by our observation of what the patient’s brainstem is doing)
### Slide 16
- Schema for Ventilatory Failure
### Slide 17
- Need to exhale CO2: Supply vs Demand
- You can understand this with equations, but they’re not required.
- Fundamental Rules:
- Molecules of CO2 produced Molecules of CO2 exhaled to maintain homeostasis
- Amount of CO2 you exhale is proportional to the amount of air that meets blood coming back to the heart from the tissues.
- Amount of work is proportional to the amount of air you move past your nose & mouth (RRVt)
- 𝑉𝐸∝𝑉𝐶𝑂21 −𝑉𝑑𝑉𝑡∗𝑃𝑎𝐶𝑂2

### Slide 20
- L Main PA Occlusive Thrombus
- Blood no longer goes to L lung
- Inhaled air does
- Therefore, 2x the ventilation (mouth) required for same gas-exchange

- Ventilation (past mouth)
- Ventilation participating in gas-exchange (Alveolar Ventilation)
- ½ of the mouth ventilation
- Wasted ventilation (no blood flow to this side)

### Slide 40
- Summary:
- Keep O2 and CO2 problems separate in your thinking
- Low O2 is not the main cause of dyspnea
- If it’s real and it doesn’t get better with 6L, it’s shunting.
- Symptoms are driven by CO2 flux
- Symptoms occur when it’s hard to sustain what you need
- Do they need a lot?
- High metabolic rate, Inefficient Ventilation, Low blood CO2
- Can they not sustain much?
- Bellows don’t work, Breathing control doesn’t work, Loads on system
