### Slide 4
- Other options?
### Slide 5
- Cp-Kpn (Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella Pneumoniae)
- KPC is a type of beta-lactamase encoded on plasmids
- Carbapenems are beta-lactams
- KPC also confers resistance to cefepime, quinolones, TMP-SMX
- KPC has been found in Klebsiella and PsA
- Nosocomial; selection thought to have resulted from failure to clean medical equipment (repeat broad spectrum antibiotic exposures)
### Slide 6
- How does Ceftazidime-Avibactam work?
### Slide 7
- How does Ceftazidime-Avibactam work?
- Ceftazidime – 3rd gen ceph but + ~85% PsA coverage, poor anaerob coverage.
- Avibactam – beta-lactamase inhibitor (broader than tazobactam)
- Other options:
- Meropenem-Vaborbactam, colistin (polymixins)
### Slide 8
- What is ceftaroline and how is it used?
### Slide 9
- What is ceftaroline and how is it used?
- 5th generation Cephalosporin with MRSA/VRSA activity and good gram positive activity. GNR coverage is similar to CTX
- Hydrolyzed by KPC
### Slide 10
- What are the types of beta-lactamases?
- ESBL
- Carbapenemases (subtype of ESBL)
- AmpC (inducible, subtype of ESBL)
- How to recognize:
- GNR – resistant to CTX
- +/-S to Cefepime (reported)
- S to meropenem
- R to Erta/Mero
- SPACE/SPICE-M organism – will appear susceptible but in fact will not be. Can be CTX sensitive on report.
- Treatment
- Cefepime if susceptible, Mero if not.
- NOT Zosyn.
- Ceftaz-Avibact;
- Mero-Vaborbact;
- Colistin
- Carbapenem (induces, but not hydrolyzed); Cefepime (doesn’t induce much. But is hydrolyzed so can be ok). NOT Zosyn, CTX.
- Serratia marcescens, Providencia, PsA, Citrobacter, Enterobacter (40%), Morganella morganii
### Slide 11
- GNR Bacteremia with CTX resistance – abx?
### Slide 12
- GNR Bacteremia with CTX resistance – abx?
- NOT AmpC in this study (unless also present with another ESBL, 10%)
### Slide 13

### Slide 14
- TODO: No text extracted from this slide.
### Slide 15
- Methotrexate, HyperCa neurotoxicity
- Weekly MTX: Headache, fatigue, malaise, impaired ability to concentrate
- CNS folate metabolism disruption.
- Can get acute stroke/seizure-like presentation, but more common with high (chemo) or intrathecal dosing.
- Hypercalcemia: anxiety, irritability, depression, cognitive impairment
- confusion, stupor, and coma if severe
### Slide 16
- Sarcoidosis Small Fiber Neuropathy
- Destruction of thin myelinated and unmyelinated fibers (nociception, heat, autonomic function)
- +Allodynia
- Autonomic dysfunction rarely occurs alone.
- Exclude DM, B12 def, thyroid
- NCS is normal; biopsy specific but not sensitive.
- Incidence not well known
- Unique: Resistant to pred & methotrexate - ?IVIG and TNF-alpha; symptom management (capsaicin)

### Slide 19
- How does Dabigatran work?
### Slide 20
- How does Dabigatran work?
- Direct thrombin inhibitor
- Not Xa inhibitor!
- Direct
- Indirect
- (mediated by ATIII)
- Xa inhibition
- Rivaroxaban
- Apixaban
- Edoxaban
- Enoxaparin
- Fondaparinux
- Thrombin inhibition
- Dabigatran
- Bivalrudin
- Argatroban
- Unfractionated Heparin
### Slide 21
- TODO: No text extracted from this slide.
### Slide 22
- Heparin
- Thrombin + Xa inhib
- Protamine
- Time based:
- Immediate 1U/100U hep
- …
- 120 minutes 0.25u/100u hep
- Enoxaparin/Dalteparin
- Thrombin inhib
- <4h – 1mg per 1mg
- 4-8 – 0.5 mg per 1mg
- Fondaparinux
- 4F-PCC
- 50u/kg
- Dabigatran
- Idaracizumab
- 5 grams IV
- Apixaban
- Xa inhib
- 4F-PCC or Andexanet
- 50 u/kg; 400mg then 4mg/min
- Rivaroxaban
- 50 units/kg; 800 u then 8mg/min
- Edoxaban
- 4F-PCC (not andexanet)
- 50 units/kg
- Warfarin
- Vit-k epoxide-reductase inhib
- Vit K; FFP; 4F-PCC
- Vit K: 2.5-10 mg (use INR)
- FFP: 15 ml/kg
- PCC: 2-4 25u/kg, 4-6 35u/kg, 6+ 50u/kg
### Slide 23
- Idarucizumab (Praxbind)
- Dabigatran (Pradaxa) – eliminated by the kidneys
- Fab fragment (antibody) that binds dabigatran w/ 350x better affinity than thrombin.
### Slide 24
- Andaxant Alfa
- Decoy Xa (molecular similar) – Xa inhibitors bind to it instead
- Unlike factor Xa, it does not convert prothrombin to thrombin
- Tested in (direct) Xa inhibitors – Edoxaban, Apixaban, Rivaroxaban
- Probably works in enoxaparin too, but not formally evaluated
### Slide 25
- Protamine
- Big positively charged molecule – forms a stable salt with negatively charged heparin
- If given alone, protamine is an anticoagulant
- If given w/ heparin – will pair up and make the salt.
- Also pairs up with enoxaparin/dalteparin, but not quite so effectively.
### Slide 26
- 4F – PCC (K-Centra)
- Prothrombin complex concentrate
- Factors 10, 9, 7, 2; and protein C and S.
- Smaller volume infusion than FFP (15-20mL/kg)
### Slide 27
- Your patient is bleeding; found down. Lab test to assess AC?
- Apixaban: Anti-Xa levels
- Dabigatran: Thrombin time, aPTT. NOT INR
- Edoxaban: Anti-Xa levels, INR
- Rivaroxaban: Anti-Xa levels, INR (50% will have anticoag w/ normal) -> not sufficient to exclude.

### Slide 44
- What things cause PaO2-SpO2 gap?
### Slide 45
- What things cause PaO2-SpO2 gap?
- SpO2 absorption spectrum @ 660 and 940 nm.
- Hemoglobinopathy changes absorption spectrum
- iStat sometimes don’t actually do co-oximetry – they calculate a predicted oxygen saturation.
- Need “co-oximetry” - measure oxy-, deoxy-, carboxy-, and methemoglobin
### Slide 46
- Hemoglobinopathies
- Sickle hb no change in absorption spectrum
- Carboxyhemoglobinemia
- Methemoglobinemia
- 95-100% apparent SpO2
- 85% apparent SpO2
- COHb O2Hb
- Met-Hb blue absorption
### Slide 47
- Physiology
- Oxidizing agent (electron acceptor) takes Fe++ (Ferrous) to Fe+++ (Ferric) metHb
- Normally, reducing agent (CyB5R) converts it back
- Met-Hb, like CO-Hb, binds O2 more tightly. Shifts O2-hb to the left
- SpO2 based only on the color of the molecule
- O2 Physiology identical to COHb
### Slide 48
- Why did this patient get Met-Hb?
- Oxidizing Agents:
- Dapsone
- Antimalarials (CQ, Quinones)
- Topical anesthetics
- iNO, nitrites, nitrates
- Anilene Dyes
- Metoclopramide
### Slide 49
- How to treat?
- Reducing Agents:
- Methylene blue -> cofactor in Fe+++ to Fe++ transition.
- Beware in G6PD deficiency this won’t work.
### Slide 50
- What is Sodium nitrite/thiosulfate used for?
- Cyanide poisoning options:
- Hydroxycoabalmin – first line, directly binds. 70mg/kg. Interferes w Co-ox
- Induction of methemoglobinemia with amyl/sodium nitrite, which can then be reduced. Don’t do this if CO-Hb/Smoke (further reduce O2-Hb availability)
- Sulfur donors e.g. sodium thiosulfate turn cyanide to thiocynates which are renally eliminated.
- 1 and 3 are recommended.
