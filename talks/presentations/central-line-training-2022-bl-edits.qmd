- D. Light activation
### Slide 9
- Background
- 1929 Dr. Werner Forssman inserted a ureteric catheter through his cubital vein into the right side of his heart
- 1953 Seldinger technique was first described for arteriography
- In the early 2000 approximately 8% of hospitalized patients required central venous access with more than 5 million catheters placed yearly in the US
### Slide 10
- Case
- 72 F with DMII presents to the ED with 1 week of progressive cough, dyspnea, and fevers. She recently attended a family wedding where several contacts later tested positive for COVID.
- ED: Hypotensive to 76/48 after 2 L IVF, tachycardic to 120s. She has 2 PIVs (20 g R forearm, 22g L hand) and norepinephrine is started at .1 mcg/kg/min prior to arrival to the MICU.
- The nurse asks if you are going to place a central line when the patient arrives in the ICU
### Slide 11
- Indications for Central Venous Catheters
### Slide 12
- Types of Central Venous Catheters
- Triple (Quad) Lumen CVC
- Introducer Sheath (Cordis, PSI) & MAC: contains port for PA-catheter or pacer) and 9 Fr (big) infusion port
- Dialysis catheter (2 large lumens +/- an additional medication port)
- Peripherally-Inserted Central Catheter (PICC; 1-3 lumens)
- Tunneled lines (various; iHD, or medications e.g. Hickman)
### Slide 13
- TODO: No text extracted from this slide.
### Slide 14
- Risks
- Bleeding: insertion site, subq/retroperitoneal hematoma, mediastinal, hemothorax
- 0.5%-1.6%
- Infection (i.e. CLABSI)
- 0.5% - 1.4%- no statistically significant difference between insertion sites
- Vascular injury
- 4.2-9.3% arterial puncture, <1% arterial injury
- Pneumothorax (requiring chest tube)
- 0.5% IJ
- 1.5% subclavian
- Thrombosis (symptomatic)
- 0.5% - 1.4% (femoral > IJ ~ subclavian)
- Wolfe KS, Kress PJ. Chest 2016;150(1):237-246.
- Parienti JJ, et al. New Eng J Med 2015;373(13):1220-1229.
### Slide 15
- Contraindications
- Few strong contraindications
- Distorted vessel anatomy- thrombosis, vascular injury
- Infection overlying catheter insertion site
- Relative contraindications: alternative site
- Coagulopathy
- Thrombocytopenia
- Elevated ICP
- Hemothorax or pneumothorax risk
### Slide 16
- Procedural Order
### Slide 17
- Supplies
- Central Line
- Contains line and most of your supplies
- Central Line Kits
- Need: Line caps (3), Luer lock syringe, saline flushes NOT sterile
- OR towels, extra gown, gauze
- Line caddy
- Sterile gloves
- Ultrasound probe cover
- Line dressing
### Slide 18
- Positioning: Key to Success
### Slide 19
- Positioning
- Pigott et al. Bedside Ultrasonography, Central Line Placement: Treatment & Medication. eMed Updated: Oct 30, 2009
### Slide 20
- Anatomy
- High Neck
- Mid Neck
### Slide 21
- Anatomy
- Low Neck
### Slide 22
- Ultrasound Color Doppler
### Slide 23
- Always Maintain Sterility
- Position patient
- Open supplies onto table steriley
- Cleanse insertion site with antiseptic
- 30 seconds drying time
- Don sterile gown/gloves
- Drape patient
- Speak up if you think you might have broken sterile field
### Slide 24
- Seldinger Technique
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?vhmEMUCaU1y0
### Slide 25
- Checking Placement
### Slide 26
- Post procedure: CXR confirmation
- Assess correct placement/catheter termination
- Cavoatrial junction is 1.5-2 vertebrae below carina
- SVC placement is generally fine
- Assess for complication
- Pneumothorax
- Inappropriate vessel
- Right side should NOT cross midline
- Left side SHOULD cross midline

### Slide 39
- Learning Points
- You must be able to consent a patient independently for a central line to meet ABIM requirements: know indications and complication rates.
- Evaluate each confirmation x-ray: terminates between SVC-Atria?, Crosses Midline?, Pneumothorax?
- Never be afraid to admit you broke sterility
