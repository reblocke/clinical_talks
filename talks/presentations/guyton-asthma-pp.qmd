## Summary
- Does PP tell influence the likelihood of preload responsiveness?
- Pressure in Right Atrium (mmHg)
- Considerations in Tamponade and Asthma
- Cardiac Output (L/min)
- Mean systemic filling pressure
- Venous return does not increase further due to venous collapse
-  Actual CO and RApressure that results
- Right Ventricle Starling Curve

## Slide outline
### Slide 1
- Does PP tell influence the likelihood of preload responsiveness?
- Considerations in Tamponade and Asthma
### Slide 2
- Pressure in Right Atrium (mmHg)
- Cardiac Output (L/min)
- Mean systemic filling pressure
- Venous return does not increase further due to venous collapse
-  Actual CO and RApressure that results
- Right Ventricle Starling Curve
### Slide 3
- Pressure in Right Atrium (mmHg)
- Cardiac Output (L/min)
- Mean systemic filling pressure
- Venous collapse happens at higher RA pressure due to elevated Ppericardium
- Right Ventricle Starling Curve
- Pulsus Paradoxus in Tamponade
- Fluids increase mean systemic filling pressure, and thereby increase CO where venous return plateaus
- Large change in CO
### Slide 4
- Pressure in Right Atrium (mmHg)
- Cardiac Output (L/min)
- Mean systemic filling pressure
- Venous return already elevated due to below atmospheric intra-thoracic pressure from respiratory efforts (up to -30 cmH2O)
- Fluids only move RApressure and CO operating point further onto flattened portion of RV starling curve
- Right Ventricle Starling Curve – flattened due to increased afterload/PVR due to elevated lung volumes
- Pulsus Paradoxus in Asthma
- Small (if any – depending where exactly Starling curve flattens) change in CO
- Limitation: Guyton curves use gauge pressure, whereas relevant pressure in Asthma are transmural pressures because intrathoracic pressure is negative during inspiration, may be positive on expiration if air trapping
