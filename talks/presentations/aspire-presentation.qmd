### Slide 2
- Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure: ’Syndrome’
- Definition: PaCO2 too high (> 45 mmHg)
- Key physiologic principles:
- Occurrence of CO2↑ : Ventilatory Control or Actuator Frailty?
- Metabolic parabola means those with hypercapnia are more prone to decompensation
- Many patients are first identified during decompensation:
- higher risk for morbidity
- also, more available data
- Acute management effective, but what should happen after the admission?
- Build up here CO2 in blood rises
### Slide 3
- Proposed framework:Sufficient vs Component Causes (Rubin)
- Obesity
- Untreated
- Sleep Apnea
- COPD
- Loop diuretic
- Opiates
- Sufficient cause: a set of factors that will cause disease when present
- End-stage COPD with hyperinflation
- Component cause: a factor that, if not present, no disease would occur
- Untreated OSA, metabolic alkalosis, chronic opiate use
- Hypothetical patient with hypercapnic respiratory failure

- Retrospective Reviews: mirrors what rate these are diagnosed (not what rate they present)
- What is the role of sleep-disordered breathing?
### Slide 9
- What is the role of sleep-disordered breathing?
- COPD (66%)
- No COPD (33%)
- AHI Median [IQR]
- 31.9 [14.3, 45.6]
- 66.0 [48.0, 83.8]
- AHI > 15 present
- 66%
- 94%
- AHI > 30 present
- 51%
- 81%
- Overall prevalence of severe OSA ( AHI > 30 ) in survivors over 50%
- & No prior OSA Dx
- N36 survivors of hypercapnia; n16 agreed to PSG. 56% with AHI > 30 /hr
### Slide 10
- Needs: initial decompensation → treatment
- Presentation With Hypercapnia
- Hypercapnia is common, highly morbid, and likely increasing in frequency (obesity, opiates, multimorbidity)
- Correctly Recognized?
- Causes Correctly Diagnosed?
- Is there data to guide treatment?
- Is it logistically possible?
- Does it happen?
- Inpt Hypercapnia is frequently missed in practice
- Many patients do not receive definitive testing
- We don’t know what to do for many (most?) patients with hypercapnia
- Device qualification restrictions.
- Requires coordination between Inpt  Outpt. Consider CHF (CMS f/u after discharge)
- Marik, JICM 2012: 75% miss rate.
- Nowbar, AJM 2004
- OSA in 5-15% vs 50-80%
- No good estimate? (NMD/Rest, COPD, OHS, OVS)
- No good estimate?
### Slide 11
- Computable phenotypes: algorithms to identify specific patient cohorts
- Problems with retrospective EHR-based research:
- Missing Data
- Time/Event determination (immortal time)
- Observational nature (residual confounding; multiple comparisons)
- Disease Identification
- Contrast: Cohort study with assessment and verification of diagnostic labels. Particularly, respiratory diagnoses (Asthma, COPD, OHS, OSA)
- Precise definitions (phenotypes) can help with patient identification
- Simple: Inclusion criteria to a study
- Complex: use additional data elements (demographics, meds), natural-language processing, etc.
### Slide 12
- Why might this help in Hypercapnic RF? (why not just use PaCO2 > 45 mmHg?)
- ABGs are variably obtained in clinical practice: less reliable in usual care than enrollment criteria
- People who get ABGs are different from people who don’t
- Symptoms are variable, the diagnosis is often missed.
- Pre-test probability varies widely by demographic and comorbidity; optimal evidence may vary too
- Pre-test Odds LR (Strength of Evidence) Post-test Odds
- Study Aim
- Efficacy Trial
- Determine Burden of Disease
- Improve Processes of Care
- Ideal Characteristic
- Select a population with severe disease, homogeneous in characteristic that predicts treatment responsiveness
- Capture all patients who suffer from the adverse consequences of hypercapnic respiratory failure
- Identify all patients who will benefit from instituting certain management pathways
- Example
- Severe COPD, no other cause of CO2, severe air trapping, PaCO2 > 52 mmHg
- More sensitive definition?
- (If only use PaCO2, you will miss patients and skew toward people with classic/severe presentation)
### Slide 13
- Gap & Hypothesis
- Methods used in the literature will identify different populations
- Those populations will differ in ways important to prognosis or treatment response (such as comorbidities, management)
- Data from EHR’s are sufficiently granular to identify pathophysiology-based endotypes, which is currently presumed to matter clinically, but not reflected in current epidemiologic data.
- These endotypes may predict risk and heterogeneity in treatment responsiveness, and thus would be useful to identify

### Slide 18
- Methods: Data Request
- We requested data on all inpatient encounters where the individual met one of the following criteria
- ICD group, Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure ICD Code. Patients with an inpatient diagnostic code for any of the following:
- · J96.12 (chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia),
- · J96.02 (acute hypercapneic respiratory failure),
- · J96.22 (acute and chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia),
- · J96.92 (respiratory failure unspecified with hypercapnia),
- · E66.2 (morbid obesity with hypoventilation)
- ABG Group, First ABG showing Hypercapnia. Patients who have a value over 45 on the first first of any of the following lab codes obtained during the hospitalization
- · LOINC 2019-8 Carbon Dioxide [ Partial Pressure ] Arterial Blood over 45[BL3]
- · LOINC 32771-8 Carbon Dioxide [ Partial Pressure] adjusted to patient’s actual temperature in arterial blood over 45
- · LOINC 11557-6 Carbon Dioxide [ Partial Pressure] in Blood over 45
- And:
- Age > 18 at admission
- Admission between 1-1-2018 and 9-28-2022
- Only first admission for per-individual that met the criteria
- Cross-sectional analysis:
- no dependence on cross-encounter data (to limit data quality issues)
### Slide 19
- Methods: Data Processing
- Mechanisms of Data Missingness:
- E.g. Diagnoses
- For a given encounter, the institution must have submitted some data (any data) for each of the data elements requested.
- Data validation measures:
- Positive controls: e.g if dx of Pna, expect abx Rx
- Negative controls: <BMI 30 in OHS
- True (patho)physiologic state
- What the clinician recognizes
- What the clinician documents
- What information is structured
- What data is aggregated in TriNetX
- Problem for our study
- Missing data here is part of what we want to study
### Slide 20
- Results: Cohort Description
- Final cohort: 119,816
- ‘Missing’ Data Rates:
- ABG: 30%; VBG 70%
- BMP, CBC elements 3%
- Triage VS: 30% (BP) -70% (SpO2)
- Control outcomes:
- Receive paralytic → IMV code? 80% (OR?)
- AECOPD/Asthma → Systemic Steroid? 88%
- Pneumonia dx code → CAP Antibiotic? 81%
- 56% have critical care services billed
- 52% with acidemia (<7.35 pH); higher likelihood of critical care (OR 1.77)

### Slide 24
- Who do guidelines apply to?
- Based on diagnostic codes present
- ATS OHS Guideline (2019):
- Obesity with Hypoventilation Dx: 4,839 (4%)
- Obese and no COPD/Asthma/CHF/NMD/OUD Dx: 62,400 (51%)
- Missing data…
- Obese and OSA and no COPD/Asthma/CHF/NMD/OUD dx: 7,538 (6%)
- ATS COPD NIV Guideline (2020): 9,659 (9%)
- Neither guideline: 40-87%
### Slide 25
- Can we identify relevant physiology?
- COPD
- OSA
- OUD
- TODO:
- Principal Component Analysis: most parsimonious set of variables that explains how patients with hypercapnia differ from each other
- Clustering on this vs. expert features (can’t vs won’t breathe; compensation etc.)
- → physiologic endotypes?
- Conditional Probability the Dx is Present
### Slide 26
- Strengths and Limitations
- What does ”big data” get you?
- Less susceptible to idiosyncratic local patterns; maybe increased representativeness
- Power for subgroup investigations
- Data hungry algorithms
- All single-encounter data (cross-sectional) due to data quality
- Can’t evaluate readmissions, mortality, subsequent outpatient management.
- Data quality: contingent on local practices (hard to assess)
- Doesn’t include patients where ABG wasn’t ordered or Dx not given\
- Inferences about underlying true physiology much less robust than inferences about coding practices and inclusion criteria due to secondary use data.
### Slide 27
- Take aways:
- Multiple etiologic causes contribute to hypercapnia in many cases and further research is needed to guide how to address high rates of morbidity and mortality.
- Rationale exists that current tools (e.g. PAP; or rehab, acetazolamide, etc) could be utilized
- Different Cohort definitions do select non-overlapping and clinically different subsets
- These cohorts differ in comorbidity distribution and physiology → treatment responsiveness and prognosis?
- Therefore, the interpretability of future research might be improved with agreed-upon definitions
- Next step: How should we identify patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure
### Slide 28
- Next steps: How should we identify patients?
- Request TriNetX dataset including:
- Patients with hypercapnic RF (ICD, PaCO2)
- Patients a reasonable clinician might suspect to have hypercapnic RF
- Other respiratory failure + predisposing condition (e.g. NMD)
- +VBG CO2 over 48 mmHg
- Severe Obesity and elevated bicarbonate
- …etc
- Model: predictive abilities of feature (or their combinations)
- Output: Usable by researchers
- Accuracy vs Usability (NLP?)
- Binary output vs Probability?
- ICD Hypercap code and ABG CO2 > 45
- ICD Hypercap code and only VBG w CO2 > 48

### Slide 29
- The Issue of The Reference Standard
- No Free Lunch: Except for measuring, all methods rely on assumptions
- Formulation as a missing data problem
- Withold ABG results and perform supervised learning on those with ABGs
- Model propensity to obtain P(ABG) and generated Inverse Probability Weights
- Assumptions not met, but would it be better?
- Classification (Hypercapnia vs not) → Prediction (risk of hypercapnia-morbidity)
- Validate sparse definition to richer data-set
- How well can you do with data elements available in NCUPS Readmission Db?
- Prospective: Also allows for
- Bridges the “documentation to physiology gap”
- Allows for more robust assessment of comorbidity status
- Nowbar 2004 used ABG → TcCO2 more tolerable?
