### Slide 3
- How does hyponatremia cause problems?
- Why does DKA cause “hyponatremia” on labs, but symptoms of “hypernatremia” (thirst/dehydration, AMS)
### Slide 4
- How does hyponatremia cause problems?
- Osmolarity: number of particles in 1L ( that drops the freezing point 1.86 Kelvin; independent of size/weight of particles)
- Osmolality: number of particles of 1kg of solvent.
- Tonicity: effective osmolality of solutes that can act across a semi-permeable membrane
- Osm: property of particle in solution; Tonicity property of solution in relationship to a semipermeable membrane (cell membrane)
- Na+: exerts osmotic pressure
- Glu: moves across semipermeable membranes w/ insulin – transient (usually)
- Urea, ethanol, lactate: passively moves across semipermeable membrane: no osmotic pressure

- 50 mOsm: max 12L
- 1200 mOsm: min 0.5L
### Slide 19
- DDAVP clamp:
- ALL of the risk of over-correction comes from solute being given when ADH is low ( body can now dump free water at Uosm 50 osm/L)
- Adrogue-Madias equation: 1L NS in 70kg w/ Na 105 -> 107.5
- 2 options:
- D5W to match the urine output (that’s a lot of D5; ‘iatrogenic polydipsia’)
- Give ADH back (useful whenever UOP high or might become high)
- DDAVP 2 mcg IV q8hr, continued until Na at target
- Give 3% Saline to increase
- Do nothing to keep unchanged
- Give D5w to decrease
### Slide 20
- Hyponatremia: summary
- Tools for residents: Serum Osm, Urine Osm, Urine Na (FENa)
- Tools for fellows: UOP, response to solutes, clinical circumstance, cycling the labs prn
- If the ED gave 1L IVF and the [Na] didn’t budge or worsened:
- SIADH etc., or appropriate ADH presence from hypervol/maldistributed
- If the ED gave 1L IVF and the patient is making more than 250+ cc/hr
- They either had no ADH to start, or reason for ADH is gone (hypovol)
- Start DDAVP 2 mcg IV q8h
### Slide 21
- Hypernatremia
- 60kg -> 600 mOsm/d solute; 50 mOsm: max 12L; 1200 mOsm/L: min 0.5L
- With normal solute intake and less than 500cc water, you’d get hypernatremic
- If you have Diabetes Insipidus, your maximum concentration drops. If max Uosm 600 mOsm/L, then <1L leads to hypernatremia. If Uosm 300, <2 L leads to hypernatremia, etc.
- High urine output, CNS tumor, long term lithium and hypernatremic? Check Uosm
- 1200 mOsm minimum of 1L of maximally concentrated UOP
### Slide 22
- Does someone who eats 2g of Na/d drink the same H2O as someone who eats 4g of Na/d?
- Yes – at steady state – in out.
- Over a large range of sodium intake, urine production and thus fluid intake will be constant
- More natriuresis occurs in people who eat more salt.
### Slide 23
- Physiology Review
- Large bolus of free water?
- ADH shuts off. Kidneys produce dilute urine. Electrolytes and volume status unchanged.
- For avg (10 mOsm/kg/day) diet, ADH fully off 50 mmol/L (maximally dilute) 70 kg person > 700 mmol load > 50 mmol/L excretion > 14L of free water can be excreted per day without perturbing sodium balance.
- Large bolus of sodium?
- Maximal natriuresis ~280 mmol/L (2x serum, roughly).
- Why? There is NO active sodium excretion along the nephron
### Slide 24
- The nephron doesn't have a dedicated method to excrete sodium.
- Instead, the kidneys concentrate urine by increasing urea concentration in the medulla.
- Counter-intuitively, to maintain osmolality the major mechanism after an ingestion of salt is not thirst, but free water re-absorption in the kidney (ie. concentration of urine)
- It takes time to generate this gradient
- Kidneys retain water (with ADH) to maintain [Na] in serum in the interim
- Glucocorticoid driven catabolism to generate urea
- Increase urea in the renal medullary interstitium
- Increase osmotic gradient to reabsorb free water
### Slide 25
- If someone who normally eats low Na diet eats high Na diet, do they drink more water?
- Healthy people randomized to either low sodium (0.5 g) to regular (3.2g) diet, then swap
- After increased Na load: takes ~3-5 days to reach a new steady state with kidney able to match Na load
- On the first day: only half of excess Na load excreted
- The positive sodium balance caused fluid retention and an increase in body weight of over 1 kg.
- No difference in fluid intake (free-water reabsorption makes up difference)
### Slide 26
- Na and fluid loading in the ICU
- 1L of NaCl 3.5gm (154 mmol Na) ~7 gm NaCl
- Consider COVID-ARDS:
- ~750 cc/d NS from Ketamine, 350 cc/d from Fentanyl 100 cc/d ciastricurium, 200 from CTX
- ~4g of sodium just from sedation and NMB
### Slide 27
- ADH is also a weak Anti-natriuretic Hormone
- Healthy volunteers drank either:
- Low hydration: free water 0.25 mL/kg q30m (35 mL/hr for 70kg) or
- High hydration: water 2.0 mL/kg q30m ( 288 mL/h for 70kg).
- Then received 250cc 2% NaCl
- High hydration: excrete the extra sodium immediately.
- Low hydration cannot (ADH crosstalk, maximal concentration ability of kidneys)
- Meaning: the kidneys CANNOT create low free water, high Na urine
### Slide 28
- Physiology Review:
- The kidneys have mechanisms to quickly adjust free water clearance.
- The kidney does not have a fast mechanism to increase natriuresis – it takes several days and catabolism to achieve this.
- Limitation in free water hampers natriuresis due to ADH crosstalk.
- While the kidney is adapting to a new baseline sodium intake, fluid retention occurs in the kidney (regardless how much fluid they drink).
- Therefore, it is very hard to achieve balanced I/O during salt loading
### Slide 29
- Bad ARDS Circle of Life
- Many Drips
- (in NS)
- Lasix & no
- free H2O
- Fluid Overload
- Hypernatremia
### Slide 30
- Single-day, point prevalence survey: 46 Australian and New Zealand ICUs on 21 September 2011
- Median sodium admin: 224.5 mmol (IQR, 144.9-367.6 mmol). 2.8 mmol/kg (IQR, 1.6-4.7 mmol/kg).
- Patients Day 2-10 of ICU admission:
- maintenance or replacement intravenous (IV) infusions, 69.3mmol; 30.9% of all sodium sources;
- IV fluid boluses, 36.5 mmol; 16.3%;
- IV drug boluses, 27.6 mmol; 12.3%;
- enteral nutrition, 26.5 mmol; 11.8%;
- IV drug infusions, 19.3 mmol; 8.6%;
- IV flushes, 16.6mmol; 7.4%;
- blood products, 13.5 mmol; 6%;
- IV antimicrobials, 11.2mmol; 5%;
- parenteral nutrition, 4.3 mmol; 1.9%.
- Median 5 grams of Na per day
- Double the usual intake
### Slide 31
- Why do we dissolve medications in NaCl?
- ICUs have pre-mixed versions of medications to deliver quickly (ie. antibiotics, fentanyl)
- Some meds are sodium salts ( any negative ion paired with a sodium cation) – generally more soluble in water than the acid form
- A few medications must be given in NS
- It’s the default
### Slide 32
- TODO: No text extracted from this slide.
### Slide 33
- Clinical impact - TOPMAST trial
- Blind randomization of 70 patients undergoing major thoracic surgery to [Na] 154 mmol/L vs [Na] 54 mmol/L fluid
- Primary: Net fluid balance: Na154 +4.5L vs Na54 3.12L despite identical fluid infused
- Secondary:
- Pulmonary Edema: Na154 17%, Na54 3%
- Electrolyte abnormalities:
- Na154 – n3 had Na above 145.
- N24 had Cl- above ULN
- Na54 – n4 patients had Na
- below 135.
### Slide 34
- The patient is hypernatremic and congested:
- Reduce Na intake (The Orme approach- is the patient on Nepro?)
- Wait – their kidneys will adapt in 3-5 days
- Give them more D5w – this will allow natriuresis by decreasing ADH
- Maybe we should default to meds in D5w instead of NS?
- If you give 2L D5w… say next day the ins 3L, outs 3L – have you made progress? Stay tuned…
### Slide 35
- Bad ARDS Circle of Life
- Many Drips
- (in NS)
- Lasix & no
- free H2O
- Fluid Overload
- Hypernatremia
- Use D5W instead
- Driven By Na Overload
- Liberal free water can allow natriuresis
### Slide 36
- Congestion
- Disorders of H2O homeostasis: Hypernatremia and Hyponatremia
- Disorders of Na homeostasis: Congestion and Hypovolemia
- Yet
- On rounds, we present “(mLs) in and out” and not ”Na in and Na out”
- Why?
### Slide 37
- “Despite hospitalization for HF being exceptionally common, expensive, and morbid, we have not a single Class I Level of Evidence: A guideline recommendation to guide our care of these patients”
### Slide 38
- A patient is congested: what initial orders are important?
- Na restriction of 2g per day? Yes or No
- Fluid restriction of 2L per day? Yes or No
- Strict I/Os and Daily weights? Yes or No
### Slide 39
- Salt and Fluid Restriction
### Slide 40
- Salt and Fluid Restriction causes… thirst
### Slide 41
- What is the problem with I/O and Kg?
- Assumptions:
- For I/O to be a surrogate of net natriuresis:
- [Na] intake constant
- D5 / NS
- [UNa] constant
- Breaking phenomenon
- Recording is accurate.
- In reality, it is not
### Slide 42
- Natriuresis varies widely during diuresis
- Why might the Na concentration of urine vary between patients?
- Depends on ADH presence (among other other reasons).
- Tight water restriction ADH increase, natriuresis unchanged.
- Loose water restriction ADH decrease, natriuresis unchanged
### Slide 43
- Urine composition by time
- “the sodium content of diuretic-induced urine is highly variable and correlates only modestly with fluid and weight loss”
### Slide 44
- Braking Phenomenon (of natriuresis)
- Assume a patient makes no dietary changes
- Sodium clearance increases with ECF (true)
- Off diuretics, a patient takes in 3g of Na in 24h. They are at steady state. 3g of Na must be excreted in 24h. They are congested.
- If you start a diuretic, initially their ECF is unchanged (congested), but natriuresis increases.
- They eventually reach a new steady state (inout), but at a lower ECF
### Slide 45
- Discordant Diuresis and Natriuresis
- Net Na drops a little
- Net Na drops a lot
- Net I/O drops a little
- Not much response, normal [UNa]
- Good natriuresis, high [UNa]
- Net I/O drops a lot
- Good diuresis,
- Low [UNa]
- Good response, normal [Una]
### Slide 46
- Natriuresis based decongestion
- Simple: Spot urine Na > 100 2h after dose was probably effective (will lead to net 2g+ natriuresis in BID dosing)
- Complex:
### Slide 47
- Does it work?
- NCT04481919 RCT with hard outcome end-points ongoing
### Slide 48
- TODO: No text extracted from this slide.
### Slide 49
- How to dose:
- 1. DOSE trial: 2.5x home dose and IV
- 2. Assess:
- UOP should be 150 hr+ within 2h of IV dose (don’t wait 6 to see)
- UNa should be 50-70+
- Why are you not giving a higher dose?
- Would respond to
- low dose
- Needs high dose
- Give low dose
- 
- Delayed in needed care
- Give high dose
- What’s the harm?
### Slide 50
- Toxicity without volume depletion?
- 1985: Patient with oliguric AKI were given “1 g furosemide was given as a single injection over four hours. In the test group, frusemide was then continued either intravenously or orally in a dose of 3 g/24 hr until a urine output of 200 ml/hr was sustained or until the plasma creatinine fell …The serious complication of deafness occurred in two of 28 patients and in one of them this was permanent.”
- 2021: Yale Diuretic Protocol: “automated, nurse-driven, and called for administration of 2 to 12.5 mg IV bumetanide up to 3 times daily.” “rapidly escalated toward a peak of 1,500 mg IV furosemide equivalents per day that was reached in the first 2 days of the protocol in 86% of patients.” “No cases of ototoxicity (n409)
- Meta-analysis: OR 3 of developing ototoxicity when dose excess 1 GRAM daily (~40 mg/hr)
- NOT A NEPHROTOXIN
### Slide 51
- “Suspect near euvolemia due to contraction alkalosis”
- Loop diuretics create Chloride (and Sodium)-Rich urine
- Loosing Cl- rich, ‘bicarbonate poor’ urine will lead to development of alkalosis at ANY extracellular volume.
- Pendrin: Chloride – Bicarbonate exchanger to maintain neutrality
- Not “contraction” (albumin will not fix it), but “chloride depletion” (saline will).
### Slide 52
- Diurese until sCr clearly increases: No intrinsic renal injury from diuretic caused creatinine increase
### Slide 53
- Congestion: Review
- Realize that I/O’s are a surrogate for what we care about (Na flux)
- Salt and Fluid restrictions are TWDFNR in patients with normal [Na+]
- Give higher doses of loop diuretics
- Do not use elevated [HCO3-] as a reason to stop diuresing
