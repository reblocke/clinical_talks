## Slide outline
### Slide 1
- If everyone has HFpEF, does anyone?
- B Locke PGR
### Slide 2
- Patient:
- 65M with 6 months of dyspnea
- BMI 36
- Current smoking and prior inhalational drug use
- Moderate apical paraseptal emphysema; No obstruction on PFTs
- TTE with no diastolic dysfunction, mild LVH, mild left atrial enlargement
- No improvement with LABA/LAMA trial
- CPET:
- VO2 max ~45% weight normalized predicted
- VEVCO2 43
- Maximum HR 110; Significant metabolic acidosis
- Normal MVV; Low BR
### Slide 3
- 2 arguments why HFpEF at pulmonary GR
- Diagnosis of symptomatic disease
- 👎: Se (# Patients w/ finding & disease) / (# Patients w/ Finding whether or not they have disease)
- Consider how we do PFTs
- Susceptible to subtle spectrum bias
- 👍: (Likelihood in COPD) / (Likelihood in HFpEF)
- You have a differential. You want findings that discriminate between the options (NOT findings that separate has disease vs doesn’t have disease)
- Opinion: 👎 “Reason for Consult: Dyspnea; ….
- A/P: Not the lungs”
- If a reason for dyspnea is needed and possible, we should be able to diagnose it regardless where in the chain of respiration the problem occurs.
- Our expertise is the entire respiratory system
- Consider Nephrology: Recs re AKI diagnosis
- COPD
- PAH
- HFpEF
### Slide 4
- Aims
- Review diagnostic criteria for HFpEF
- Review notable (or not) findings in HFpEF
- What’s up with chronotropic incompetence?
- What’s up with the wedge?
- What’s up with the pleural pressure?
### Slide 5
- True or False: CPET is gold standard for diagnosing HFpEF?
- True
- False
### Slide 6
- True or False: CPET is gold standard for diagnosing HFpEF?
- True
- False
- The [ exercise ] RHC directly measures atrial pressures and is considered the criterion standard (100% sensitivity and specificity; C statistic, 1.0) for HFpEF diagnosis
- We will discuss this more.
### Slide 7
- CPET in CHF
### Slide 8
- Abnormalities on TTE are required to diagnose HFpEF?
- True
- False
### Slide 9
- Abnormalities on TTE are required to diagnose HFpEF?
- True
- False
- Requires evidence of increased filling pressures (R atrial pressure, PCWP, or LVEDP) at rest or with exercise. Which can be:
- TTE
- Catheterization
- Or inferred by physical exam/CXR/BNP/H2FPEF score
- 30% of patients with elevated PCWP have BNP < 100. (“BNP/NT-proBNP assays are insufficient to rule out HFpEF, particularly in younger patients, those with sinus rhythm, and those with obesity and/or normal kidney function.”)
### Slide 10
- HF2PEF (2022 ACC/AHA CPG)
- Rest PCWP 15+ OR Exercise PCWP 25+
- 60% had HFpEF
- The odds of HFpEF doubled for each 1-unit score increase
### Slide 11
- You are evaluating a patient you think has HFpEF. They do not have crackles. How does this change the likelihood they have congestion?
- A lot more likely
- A little more likely
- No difference
- Less likely
- ”[Congestion can be] inferred from physical exam”
### Slide 12
- You are evaluating a patient you think has HFpEF. They do not have crackles. How does this change the likelihood they have congestion?
- A lot more likely
- A little more likely
- No difference
- Less likely
- ESCAPE Trial: RCT of PA-C guided CHF mgmt vs clinical exam guided.
- Analysis of the 250 randomized to PA-C
- Crackles (1/3 of lung field): +LR 1.36, -LR 0.96 for predicting PCWP 22+ mmHg
- Most patients do not have crackles related to chronic, congested HF. Presence/absence of crackles barely gives any information about congestion.
- Se + Sp 100% > adds no information
### Slide 13
- Why?
- Stage 1: interstitial fluid (can be up to 500mL with minimal extra pressure). No crackles.
- Stage 2 Crescentic filling of the alveoli
- Stage 3 Alveolar Flooding. Crackles
- Stage 4 Froth in air passages
### Slide 14
- Pulmonary Edema: Interstitial & Alveolar
- Endothelial (vessels-interstitium) Gradient & Permeability: interstitial edema?
- Epithelial (interstitium-alveoli) Gradient & Permeability: alveolar edema?
- Inflammation?
### Slide 15
- In normal conditions, most fluid returns to the capillaries by starling forces, 18% by lymphatics
- In edematous states, lymphatics increase 8-10 fold
- Precapillary vasoconstriction -> divert blood flow away from portions of lung with high fluid flux. This has significant inter-individual variation that may contribute to individuals “prone-ness” to edema formation.
- Derangements/loss of protective factors can be regional: imaging findings can be “geographic” even when “cardiogenic”
- Time constant of alveolar flooding: 3 minutes
- Presentation of HF w Alveolar Edema / HF w/o Alveolar Edema
### Slide 16
- The mechanism of dyspnea in HFpEF is that PCWP increases with exertion
- True
- False
### Slide 17
- HR response to exercise is reduced in patients with HFpEF
- This was generally considered pathologic
- Chronotropic incompetence inability to meet predicted maximum heart rate
- Patients with HFpEF and chronotropic incompetence having a PM implanted were randomized to “Fast” vs ”Regular” pacing with exercise.
### Slide 18
- TODO: No text extracted from this slide.
### Slide 19
- single-blind, randomized (to nitro or placebo) cross-over trial.
- Invasive CPET in 30 patients with HFpEF
- Upright cycling at 20W (not maximal intensity exercise)
### Slide 20
- no decrease in PVR from Nitro
### Slide 21
- “These findings have important clinical implications and indicate that lowering PCWP does not decrease DOE in patients with HFpEF; rather, lowering PCWP exacerbates DOE, increases ventilation-perfusion mismatch, and worsens ventilatory efficiency during exercise in these patients. This study provides compelling evidence that a high PCWP is likely a secondary phenomenon rather than a primary cause of DOE in patients with HFpEF,”
- Things that might cause dyspnea in patients with HFpEF:
- Poor V/Q matching -> increased ventilation requirement
- Poor circulation -> stagnant hypoxemia -> hyperventilation -> increased ventilation requirement
- Elevated PCWP -> congestion -> increased respiratory system loads
- How long does it take for the interstitial edema to change?
- The combination of these two study suggests:
- The slow heart rate is probably not often a cause of dyspnea
- The high filling pressures are (acutely) required for two purposes:
- They allow for maintenance of CO by allowing for adequate preload
- They allow for V/Q matching (loss of blood flow to apices?) in the setting of congestion
### Slide 22
- If the elevated PCWP is a epiphenomena or a consequence of whatever causes the dyspnea…
- Adaptive?
- How often is HFpEF an incidental finding? (They are congested and SOB, but they are not causally related)
- Traditional Paradigm
### Slide 23
- Should RHC measurements be adjusted for intrapleural pressure for HFpEF?
- Yes/No/Maybe?
- Notably, more than 80% of patients with HFpEF are obese
### Slide 24
- Review: what did the study do?
### Slide 25
- What did they find?
- More obese patients would be candidates for vasodilators
- More obese patients would not be labeled as having PH.
- Many obese patients who previously were post-capillary will be undifferentiated (PVR > 2 but < 3, PA > 20, PCWP < 12.
### Slide 26
- Lowing afterload (diuretics) aren’t likely to help 1 and 3.
- Patient (Q3 for all)
- PAm
- PCWP (ref atm)
- Ppl
- PCWPcorr
- PVR
- PAH Class Old
- PAH Class New
- 1 – high pl, low rv afterload
- Low lv preload
- 35
- 20
- 10
- 5
- Group 2
- Group 1
- 2 – low pl, high rv afterload, high lv preload
- 0
- Group 2 (CPC)
- 3 - high pl, normal RV afterload, low LV preload
- 25
- 1.8
- Group 2 (IPC)
- No PH [or, presumably HFpEF]
### Slide 27
- Pulmonary Hypertension: Do we care about transmural or dynamic pressures? DebatableFor Heart Failure: We care about transmural pressures (for both preload and afterload)
### Slide 28
- Does ↑PCWP predict pathology or response?
- If there is heterogeneity in all of:
- The pathology leading to symptoms [surrogate for future treatment/research]
- Response to current treatments for that disease
- Diuretics will NOT help patients with elevated PCWP due to pleural pressure for e.g.
- Prognosis for people with the disease
- Then actually “” is just a bad disease definition
- What else are disease definitions supposed to accomplish?
### Slide 29

### Slide 30
- Takeaways:
- Review diagnostic criteria for HFpEF: elevated filling pressures and dyspnea
- Review notable (or not) findings in HFpEF: crackles minimally helpful
- What’s up with chronotropic incompetence? Incidental?
- What’s up with the wedge? Adaptive? Not causal to dyspnea
- What’s up with the pleural pressure? Transmural pressures diverge
- Elevated filling pressures and dyspnea is the definition of HFpEF, but it’s not a great definition
- Disparate pathologies lead to this (obesity, renal disease, OSA…)
- The elevated filling pressures are probably NOT the cause of symptoms, but an epiphenomenon or adaptive mechanism
- Symptom/Sign Interpretation: Chronic HF is not a disease of crackles; Diurese then diagnose re: CT abnormalities.
### Slide 31
- Patient:
- CPET:
- VO2 max ~45% weight normalized predicted; low AT
- VEVCO2 43
- Maximum HR 110; Significant metabolic acidosis
- VE achieved > (normal) MVV; Low (negative) BR; no obstruction pre or post.
- Interpretation:
- He has ventilatory limitation due to a high ventilation requirement (inefficient ventilation; probably from HFpEF and emphysema)… but minimal excess respiratory system loads.
- He has chronotropic incompetence
- I tried taking of the BB (no indication for it) and some evidence withdrawal helps
- Maybe an SGLT2 inhibitor (improves QoL and Exertional Capacity in HFpEF)
- He needs to quit smoking and lose weight… but inhalers?
### Slide 32
- There are no pharmacologic treatments that improve dyspnea in HFpEF? T/F
- True
- False
### Slide 33
- There are no pharmacologic treatments that improve dyspnea in HFpEF? T/F
- True
- False
- Empagliflozin and Dapagliflozin (2 trials; 12,000 patients) reduced HR of re-hospitalization (HR ~0.7) and improved Kansas CM score + 6MW in Dapa case.
- similar impact on the rate of HF hospitalizations or cardiovascular death regardless of age, sex, EF, presence of diabetes, body mass index, or kidney function (range allowed in the trials: estimated glomerular filtration rate >20-25 mL/min/1.73 m2)
- Also cardiac rehab.
