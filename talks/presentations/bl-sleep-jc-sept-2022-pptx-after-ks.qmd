## Slide outline
### Slide 1
- COMMONLY-UTILIZED STATISTICAL METHODS IN SLEEP MEDICINE FOR ESTABLISHING ASSOCIATION OR CAUSALITY
- Sept 2, 2022
- Discussants
- Brian Locke MD
- Krishna M. Sundar MD
### Slide 2
- Understanding sleep in relation to outcomes
- Sleep as a behavior which unlike others occupies a finite portion of our lifetime
- Alterations in behavior – measured through different metrics – relation to long term outcomes
- New era of assessing relationships using statistical techniques (evolved since the Framingham heart study)
- Problem with sleep
- Measurement duration confined to one night (or 1-4 weeks)
- Lack of sleep-derived biomarker (similar to HbA1C for DM) that can be used to assess sleep deprivation or degree of hypoxemia to long-term outcomes
### Slide 3
- Goals:
- Understand that the disjunctive syllogism is the structure of a scientific argument
- Know the limitations of a cross-sectional design as compared to cohort as compared to randomized trial viz-a-viz causal inference
- Understand what a hazard ratio is and why they are so common in medical research
- Know the determinants of a studies power.
### Slide 4
- Imagine it’s 1950. You discover that OSA is very common. How do you figure out if it matters?
- Proto-prototype of a Cross-sectional Study
### Slide 5
- Structure of Observational Study ‘Argument’: Disjunctive Syllogism
- ???
- If correlation isn’t causation.. Then what is it?
### Slide 6
- Causal Inference
- What is the question?
- Mortality(Tea1) vs Morality(Tea0)
- Mortality{Do(Tea1)} vs Morality{Do(Tea0)}
- The Fundamental Problem of
- Robert Frost (Maayan Harel)
### Slide 7
- In OSA, what are we we interested in?
- Consider central sleep apnea in CHF
### Slide 8
- TODO: No text extracted from this slide.
### Slide 9
- Design: Retrospective Cohort Cross-sectional
- Population: Sleep Heart Health (1995-98), n6424 (-1200 missing data)
- Exposed/Unexposed: AHI quartile (0-1.3, 1.4-4.4, 4.5-11.0, 11+)
- Also, Sleep hypoxemia and arousal index
- Outcome: Prevalent odds of CVD (why not incident?)
- Statistics: Logistic regression with possible confounders
- Findings: Quartile III and IV of AHI and %Hypoxemia indepdently associated with prevalent CVD (particularly HF and Stroke).
- Sleep-disordered Breathing and Cardiovascular DiseaseCross-sectional Results of the Sleep Heart Health Study
### Slide 10
- Statistical Teaching point:
- Ascertainment of exposure status
- Is “Have you ever been diagnosed with OSA?” accurate? (e.g. NHANES)
- How would you expect the group assignment to change if PSG was used?
- If you could design a ideal categorization of the groups, what would it be?
- How would this effect the study conclusions?
### Slide 11
- Cross-sectional vs Retrospective Cohort
- Cross-sectional study: exposure and outcome assess simultaneously
- Cohort study: exposure assessed before outcome
- Can only investigate prevalence of disease
- Pros: easy, reliable if exposure doesn’t change (eg genetics), or prior exposure hard to remember (eg diet)
- Cons: can’t determine direction of causality, current exposuresurrogate for past exposure, overrepresent longer duration cases.
### Slide 12

### Slide 13
- Obstructive Sleep Apnea as a Risk Factor for Stroke and Death
- Design: Prospective cohort (clinical)
- Population: W/o pre-existing CVD referred for SDB eval @ Yale. 1997-2000, n1022
- Exposed: Referred to clinic, AHI > 5 events/hr
- Unexposed: Referred to clinic, AHI < 5 events/hr
- Outcome: incident stroke or death, median follow-up 3.4 yr
- Statistics: Cox-regression~Kaplan Meier/Log rank/proportional hazard
- Findings: OSA associated with HR 1.97 for stroke or death after adjusting for confounders
### Slide 14
- Community vs Clinical Cohort
- Community comparison:
- (C+D) vs A
- Clinical comparison:
- C vs B
- Any factor that changes the likelihood of B+C is a potential confounder
- If, rather than population burden, you are interested in how to care for B+C, this may be the correct method
- Population of interest
- Seeks care
- Has OSA
- A
- B
- C
- D

### Slide 16
- Prospective Study of Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Incident Coronary Heart Disease and Heart FailureThe Sleep Heart Health Study
- Design: Prospective cohort (community)
- Population: Sleep Heart Health (1995-98), n6441 (-2000 excluded))
- Exposed: Mild (5-15), Moderate(15-30), Severe (30+) OSA by AHI. Mostly untreated (2.1% overall, 8.4% w mod-sev OSA treated)
- Unexposed: AHI < 5 events/hr
- Outcome: incident CHD before 4/1/06 (~8.7y)
- Statistics: Cox-regression (HR)
- Findings: More severe OSA independently associate with incident CHD (particularly CHF) in men, not women.
### Slide 17
- Confounders, Regressions
- Regression: estimate effect with “all other things held equal”.
- How do you decide what things to include?
- Confounders
- Mediators?
- Colliders?
- Is your understanding of what factors matter correct?
- Can you measure everything you want to measure?
### Slide 18

### Slide 19
- Sleep-Disordered Breathing and Mortality: A Prospective Cohort Study
- Design: Prospective cohort (community)
- Population: Sleep Heart Health (1995-98), n6441 (-147 excluded d/t OSA treatment)
- Exposed: Mild (5-15), Moderate(15-30), Severe (30+) OSA by AHI. Mostly untreated (2.1% overall, 8.4% w mod-sev OSA treated)
- Unexposed: AHI < 5 events/hr
- Outcome: (incident) death w/ ~8.2y avg follow-up
- Statistics: Cox-regression (HR)
- Findings: Mod-severe OSA (men) and severe OSA (women) associated with increased hazard of mortality. No relationship if age 70+
### Slide 20
- What is a Hazard Ratio / KM / Cox-regression?We’re all dead in the long run
- 2 versions of Russian Roulette
- X: 1:6 w/ bullet, Y: 1:4 w/ bullet
- HR (1/6) / (1/4) 0.67
- 1000 people play 11 rounds of each
- On round
- P(Surviving 10 rounds?)
- X: (5/6)^10 16% -> 160 survivors
- Y: (3/4)^10 5.6% -> 56 survivors
- RR would be 84% / 94.6% 0.88
- Round 11: X 27 die, Y 14 die yet HR higher in group Y!
- What if Group Y says screw it after 7 rounds, but we want to maximize our data?
- HR allows for “censoring of data”

### Slide 22
- Effect of continuous positive airway pressure therapy on recurrence of atrial fibrillation after pulmonary vein isolation in patients with obstructive sleepapnea: A randomized controlled trial
- Design: Open-label RCT (A3 study, Oslo)
- Population: new dx AHI 15+, ESS < 15 (etc), undergoing CA-PVI for Afib and able to tolerate CPAP during run-in period
- Exposed: randomized to auto-CPAP
- Unexposed: randomized to no CPAP
- Outcome: 2+min Afib months 3-12 after CA-PVI by loop recorder
- Statistics: logistic-regression yes/no recurrence
- Findings: Mod-severe OSA (men) and severe OSA (women) associated with increased hazard of mortality. No relationship if age 70+

### Slide 25
- Why do phase 2 trials: Why surrogates? Why process measures?
- Need to estimate each of the above parameters
- Surrogates: Chosen to show a larger effect size smaller trial
- Validity depends on them correlating with the outcome of interest
- Do NOT trust a positive clinical-outcome on a phase 2 trial powered to find a difference in a surrogate: increased error rates (Type 1 and 2)
