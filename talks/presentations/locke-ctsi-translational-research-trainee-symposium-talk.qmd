## Slide outline
### Slide 1
- Improved Recognition of Inpatient Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure
- Brian Locke, MD
- T32 Fellow
- Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Occupational Pulmonary Medicine
- Department of Internal Medicine
- University of Utah School of Medicine
- This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health under Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award 5T32HL105321 from the NIH
- and The American Thoracic Society through the Academic Sleep and Pulmonary Integrated Research/Clinical Fellowship (ASPIRE) Program
### Slide 2
- Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure
- Hypoxemic (Low O2) Respiratory Failure
- Hypercapnic (High CO2) Respiratory Failure
- Low arterial blood oxygen tension
- High arterial blood carbon dioxide tension
- (Relatively) Reliably Identified by Pulse Oximetry
- No routine non-invasive testing
- Build up here CO2 in blood rises
- Patients with hypercapnia are identified unreliably and late in their illness
### Slide 3
- E.g.: Home PAP improves mortality in ↑CO2-COPD
- Weight loss
- Medication Adjustment
- Pulmonary Rehab
- Hypercapnia is common, is probably becoming more common, and is treatable.
- Common contributors to Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure:
- Advanced Age
- Opiate Use
- Obesity
- Advanced Lung Dz
- Multimorbidity
- Population-standardized prevalence PaCO2 > 45 mmHg after excluding iatrogenic causes:
- 150 per 100,000 person/year
- Only inpatients, only those with blood gasses checked
- Comparison: Decompensated Cirrhosis 94.9 (US, 2017) per 100,000 person year
### Slide 4
- By the time patients are caught: ↑morbidity
- Inpatient ICD code for Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure
- 23% 30d readmission rate
- Same as CHF, more than MI
- 66% with recurrence
- Could we catch them earlier? Would it help?
- Decompensated Cirrhosis, for reference
### Slide 5
- Prior work:
- Tool
- Health Record-Based Modeling
- Transcutaneous CO2
- Purpose
- Refine Estimation of Pre-test Odds of Hypercapnia
- Allow non-invasive CO2 assessment (patients unlikely to consent for research ABGs)
- Limitation
- Approach only externally validated in outpatient OHS assessment
- Prior 95% agreement +/- 6 mmHg insufficient for unstratified clinical use
- Total
- No ABG Obtained
- ABG Obtained
- N
- 879,019
- 675,620
- 203,399
- Ambulatory
- 39% (343,699)
- 50% (334,457)
- 5% (9,242)
- Emergency
- 20% (175,792)
- 22% (146,066)
- 15% (29,726)
- Inpatient
- 41% (359,528)
- 29% (195,097)
- 81% (164,431)
- Candidate Predictors
- (LASSO)
- Age
- Sex
- Serum HCO3-
- Serum Potassium
- Serum Creatinine
- Admitting Dx
### Slide 6
- Probabilistic Modeling Likelihood of Hypercapnia
- Validation & Tuning
- Aim 1: Integration of NLP/LLM
- Aim 2: Prospective Validation of PPV
- Aim 3: Evaluation of Prognostic Significance
### Slide 7
- Aim 1: Optimize (and externally validate) local performance of statistical model
- Apply TriNetX model to retrospective data from the University of Utah.
- Reference standard: patients who had arterial blood gasses obtained.
- Add natural language processing using established tools / pipelines (CLAMP, LLM )
- Adjust model weights
- Generate measures of model performance (discrimination and calibration) to inform other aims
### Slide 8
- Aim 2: To estimate the prevalence of unrecognized hypercapnia in inpatients
- Methods:
- Deferred consent (CO2 Narcosis)
- Verifying Positive Predictive Value (precision) in high-risk patients is more efficient than stratified sampling of the whole population.
- Aim demonstrate possible benefit in highest risk, rathern than delineate scope of the probably (initially)
- Sample Size Calculation:
- 25% ‘prevalence’ (Nowbar); model AUC; Se/Sp TcCO2 for true reference standard 85%/85%
- How will this fail?
- Aim 1 results will influence needed sample size
- Can I access EHR data fast enough?
- Hawthorne effect? Due to hypoxemia (elevation), do they get identified earlier?
### Slide 9
- Prior work:
- Statistical Insights:
- Accuracy needed for clinical care ≠ Required accuracy for model verification
- Pre-test probability estimate allows stratified sampling → efficiency
- …
- 49: Correct 93%, Wrong 7%: weight: 1.98%
- 48: Correct 88%, Wrong 12%: weight: 2.39%
- 47: Correct 80%, Wrong 20%: weight: 2.47%
- 46: Correct 69%, Wrong 31%: weight: 2.92%
- 45: Correct 57%, Wrong 43%: weight: 3.11%
- SENSITIVITY
- SPECIFICITY
- 44: Correct 57%, Wrong 43% 3.56%
- 43: Correct 69%, Wrong 31% weight 3.73
- 42: Correct 80%, Wrong 20% weight 4.16%
- 41: Correct 88%, Wrong 12% weight 4.25%
- 40: Correct 93%, Wrong 7% weight 4.58%
- ….
- Expected test characteristics:
- sensitivity 89%
- specificity 92%
- if
- agreement ~6 mmHg
- same distribution of CO2
- Nowbar et al. 2004: All w/ BMI ≥35 kg/m2 admitted to inpatient medicine service at the Denver VA. Everyone (n277) gets an ABG. 31% had hypercapnia. Only 1/3 of those had therapy started (teams were told)
### Slide 10
- Aim 3: Estimate the potential impact of early & reliable identification
- Might clinicians already identify intervenable cases?
- Prior (limited) research:
- Marik et al. 2013: patient diagnosed with OHS are repeatedly admitted and missed diagnosed prior to their ultimate recognition
- Meservey et al. 2020: most readmissions are recurrence
- Hypothesis: Patients predicted to have had hypercapnia that was not recognized have a similar or excess risk of subsequent readmission as those identified (by blood gas and/or ICD code)
- Analogy to Cancer Screening
- The diagnostic barnyard ‘fence’:
- Birds won’t get caught
- Turtles won’t benefit form being caught
- Rabbits are the ones to focus on
### Slide 11
- Aim 3: To estimate the potential impact of early & reliable identification
- Study Design:
- Retrospective EHR-based review
- Dataset: Longitudinal, ideal self-contained system
- Exposures of interest:
- Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure by ICD code
- Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure by ABG (or by VBG) & not ICD code
- Predicted Risk of Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure by commonly-obtained data-elements
- Effect modifier: PAP/NIV therapy
- Outcome: Hazard of death or rehospitalization with hypercapnia
- Threats to validity:
- Is it the hypercapnia risk, per-se? (negative controls)
- Risk might be ameliorated by treatment
- Risk among patients with hypercapnia is not binary [ie risk PaCO290 >>> 50]
- Those who likely had hypercapnia, but were not sampled
- Model predicted to have hypercapnia
- Comparison in consequences
### Slide 12
- OVERALL: Patients with Consequentially Missed Hypercapnia can be Identified Using Health Record Elements
- OVERALL: There is a significant burden of unrecognized hypercapnia among hospitalized patients.
- 3 aims
- Aim 1: Model Refinement and Local Optimization
- Aim 2: Prospective Validation
- Aim 3: Assess Potential Impact
- Hypothesis
- Fine-tuning and refining previously derived model will improve local performance
- Patients with hypercapnia that are not recognized are common can be identified using health record elements with high positive-predictive value.
- Inpatients who were predicted, but not confirmed, to have hypercapnic respiratory failure are at high risk of adverse outcomes.
- Rationale
- The model should be optimized for local performance
- Must be verified that model identifies unrecognized hypercapnia
- Need to confirm that the identified patients face elevated risk (ABG PaCO2 is an imperfect reference standard).
- Approach
- Optimizing model performance +/- use of NLP tools) applied to U of U data
- Non-invasively sample (with TcCO2) patients predicted to have hypercapnia that teams have not recognized
- Among patients with an admission for hypercapnia that is identified, how many had preceding admissions likely to have hypercapnia?
- Design
- Retrospective, U of U
- Prospective, U of U
- Retrospective, VA
- Payoff: This work will evaluate the potential for improved recognition of hypercapnia to help a particularly high-risk, enlarging, and understudied group of patients.
- Career Development: Prospective validations of bioinformatic tools require a unique skillset

### Slide 14
- What is expected to come from this research?
- Validation of a method of stratification that can be used to:
- Facilitate the identification of patients with high CO2 → improved patient care
- Identify patients with hypercapnia (± a verification method) for study inclusion → more representative cohorts of patients.
- Enable future studies assessing:
- Overall burden of disease from hypercapnic respiratory failure
- Effect of exposures (medications, environmental, policy) on risk of hypercapnia
- Test the effect of treatment interventions on broader types of high-risk patients.
- Career-development:
- Development of models (statistical, ML, etc.) exploding in healthcare
- Bottle-neck is in prospective validation of uses, which takes a unique skillset to evaluate.
