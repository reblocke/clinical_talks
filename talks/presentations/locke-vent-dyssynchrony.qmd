## Slide outline
### Slide 1
- Ventilator Troubleshooting
- Brian Locke, MD
- Pulmonary / Critical Care Fellow
- University of Utah
### Slide 2
- Overview:
- You will be faced with one of two problems:
- “The ventilator is alarming”
- “The patient looks uncomfortable” (or, conversely, I gave sedatives to keep them comfortable).
- Physiology review: why does this happen?
- Schemas for how to address ventilator alarms and patient dyssynchrony
### Slide 3
- A warmup riddle:
- ABG is 7.15 / 75 / 50 on FiO2 1.0 and PEEP 14, RR 30, Vt 6 ml/Kg
- What will stop you from going up on each of these indefinitely?
- Oxygenation obviously can’t go above pure oxygen.
- What would happen if you kept going up on PEEP? When would you stop?
- What would happen if you kept going fast on RR?
- What would happen if you kept going up on the Vt?
### Slide 4
- Part 1: ”The Ventilator is Alarming”
- What is the alarm?
- Circuit disconnect, Breath not Delivered
- Inspect circuit for break or kink
- Minute ventilation low?
- Are you on pressure support? Put on assist control-mode
- Are you in ACPC? This is the equivalent of high pressures
- Minute ventilation high?
- Is this rapid shallow breathing? Go to patient looks uncomfortable
- Large Tidal Volume?
- Is this breath stacking? Discuss in 2nd part
- Most common: High peak pressures pressures
### Slide 5
- Why is this so hard? 2 conflicting principles of ventilator management
- Lung Protective Ventilation: ARMA, 2000
- Sedate deeply, unnaturally small breaths to protect lung
### Slide 6
- TODO: No text extracted from this slide.
### Slide 7
- Why is this so hard? 2 conflicting EBM principles of critical care
- Daily sedation vacation
- Restart at ½ dose; avoid accumulation
- Less sedation accumulation, faster weaning and extubation
### Slide 8
- Why is this so hard? 2 conflicting EBM principles of critical care
- Lung Protective Vent
- Brainstem desired Vent
- Deeply Sedated
- Lightly Sedated
- Priorities shift:
- Early in course: most inflamed lungs. Prioritize left
- Later in course: weaning crucial. Prioritize right
- Ventilator Alarms how to ensure Lung Protective Vent occurring
- Patient synchrony how to do Lung Protective Vent with least sedation
- Ideal
### Slide 9
- Assisted vs Control Breath
- What the patient is getting
- Ventilator Mode Setting
- How the ventilator is set
- Bump to 100% FiO2 for 2 minutes
- Stop the honking
- End-Inspiratory Hold
- Alarm shows up here (Yellow or Red, based on urgency)
### Slide 10
- Modes:
### Slide 11
- There are things we set and variables that result from the patient’s physiology
- In AC/VC Mode:
- We set how the breath is given: Tidal Volume, Inspiratory Time/Flow Rate
- The stiffness & airflow resistance of the lungs determine how much pressure required to achieve set Vt
- The resistance to airflow determines how fast the breath comes back
### Slide 12
- “The peak pressures are high”
- Pressure measured at the ventilator
- Measured pressure sum of two components
- 1: Resistance to flow (the pressure you feel blowing through a straw)
- 2. Distending pressure to inflate the alveoli + chest wall (the pressure you feel blowing a balloon up)
- Resistive pressure depends on flow rate!
- Distending Pressure
- Resistive Pressure
- Pressure measured here
### Slide 13
- Breath holds:
- Flow 0, then the resistive component 0. Left with only the static component.
- End-inspiratory hold measures the plateau pressure ( the pressure with the alveoli full)
- End-expiratory hold measures the PEEP ( the pressure when the alveoli is deflated)
- Resistive
- Distending
### Slide 14
- Two examples:
- Peak 55 cmH2O.
- Plateau 40 cmH2O
- Why is the pressure high?
- Plateau 15 cmH2O
### Slide 15
- Which do you care about?
- Volutrauma and Barotrauma result from elevated transpulmonary pressure (static pressure difference between the alveoli and the pleural pressure)
- LTVV we want to keep the plateau less than 30 CMH2O
- What things cause an increase in plateau pressure?
- Distending Pressure
- Resistive Pressure
- Pressure measured here
### Slide 16
- Elevated plateau pressure
- Stiff lungs (ARDS, pneumonia, pretty much any infiltrate)
- Water-logged lungs (worsening edema)
- Over-distending the alveoli
- Tidal volume is too big
- Ventilating only a single lung (Pneumothorax, main-stem intubation)
- External compression (effusion, chest wall, abdomen)
- PEEP…
- Intrinsic PEEP aka ‘auto-PEEP’, air trapping
- Extrinsic PEEP
### Slide 17
- PEEP increased by 4 cmH2O… how much should the plateau go up?
- If you recruit lung: by less than 4 cmH2O
- If you over-distend alveoli, by less than 4 cmH2O
- If both the above don’t change, it’ll go up by 4 cmH2O
- 0 mmHg
- Driving Pressure
### Slide 18
- What if peak is high, plateau is low?
- Problems with flow
- Bronchospasm
- Mucus plug
- Kink in the ventilator tubing or ETT
- Giving breaths with very fast rate
- What is the consequence of a high peak pressure if the plateau is low?
- NOTHING
### Slide 19
- Then why are the RN’s always coming to me with the peak pressure?
- You can’t accurately measure an accurate end-inspiratory hold if the patient is making inspiratory efforts
- If deeply sedated or paralyzed, will be accurate.
- Distending Pressure
- Resistive Pressure
- Pressure measured here
- Muscular Effort
- P
### Slide 20
- Expiratory hold maneuver
- Giving breath too fast
### Slide 21
- In sum,
- In ACVC, Tidal Volume and Inspiratory time are set, so pressure will vary based on the patient’s lung physiology
- Ventilator pressures (specifically, the plateau pressure) tell you about whether current ventilation is lung protective
- Tradeoff between Lung Protection (early) vs Light Sedation (late)
- High peak pressure will be the finding nurses and RTs notice
- How will this change in ACPC? (answer at end)
- Perform a breath hold (if you can) to separate causes of elevated resistance to flow (low plateau) vs high distending pressure (high plateau)
### Slide 22
- ”The patient looks uncomfortable”
- “Or, I had to go up on the sedation”
- Observation (confounded) data suggests:
- 25% of all patients have dis-synchrony
- 50% who are the vent more than a day will.
- They do worse. Maybe even worse mortality
### Slide 23
- Double Triggering -> Breath Stacking
- Two breaths are given for the patient making one respiratory effort
- This is a problem because it doubles the distention of the lung
- Cause: the patient’s brain stem wants a larger/longer inspiration than the vent gives.
- Low Tidal Volume unnatural
- Drive to breath high
### Slide 24
- Double Triggering -> Breath Stacking
- Treatment options:
- Increase sedation (often preferrable if early strict low tidal volume ventilation needed)
- Neuromuscular blockade if needed
- Increase vent inspiratory time
- increase tidal volume (often preferrable if later lighter sedation prioritized.
### Slide 25
- Flow starvation -> wasted effort
- Cause
- Patient wants more flow than the vent gives (common on ACVC)
- Consequence:
- Skeletal muscle and diaphragm strain
- Lung injury (pleural pressure negative during efforts)
### Slide 26
- Flow starvation -> wasted effort
- Treatment Options:
- Increase the flow rate to 50-60, can increase up to 80.
- This will cause peak pressure to go up
- Switch to ramp waveform
- Switch to ACPC
### Slide 27
- A warmup riddle: answers
- ABG is 7.15 / 75 / 50 on FiO2 1.0 an PEEP 14, RR 30, Vt 6 ml/Kg
- What will stop you from going up on each of these indefinitely?
- Oxygenation obviously can’t go above pure oxygen.
- What would happen if you kept going up on PEEP? When would you stop?
- Plateau is likely to increase above 30 cmH2O
- What would happen if you kept going fast on RR?
- AutoPEEP due to insufficient time to exhale
- What would happen if you kept going up on the Vt?
- What will the RNs/RTs come to you with in ACPC instead of high peak pressure?
- “Tidal volume [or Minute Ventilation] is low”. Can still check plat / do all the same troubleshooting
