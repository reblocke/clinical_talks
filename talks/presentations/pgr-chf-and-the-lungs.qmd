## Slide outline
### Slide 1
- Protean Manifestations of CHF and the lungs
- Diurese, then diagnose
### Slide 2
- DIURESE THEN DIAGNOSE
### Slide 3

### Slide 4
- Physical exam findings

### Slide 5
- Imaging Findings
- https://twitter.com/docBLocke/status/1433090969830756358?s20
### Slide 6
- CHF
- Stage 1: interstitial fluid (can be up to 500mL with minimal extra pressure)
- Stage 2 Crescentic filling of the alveoli
- Stage 3 Alveolar Flooding
- Stage 4 Froth in air passages
- Historically taught that hypoxemia and stimulation to vagal nociceptors results in hyperventilation – which may be true, until load is too great
### Slide 7
- VO2 Stress test findings
### Slide 8
- Capillary Injury
- https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jappl.2000.89.6.2483
### Slide 9
- Hyperventilation?
### Slide 10
- Colloid Oncotic Pressure – revised starling
- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6845168/
- Colloids do not help with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.
- Cardiogenic pulmonary edema?
- Starling equation
- Bronch study?
### Slide 11
- Pulm Edema DAD
- https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.202008-3149IM
### Slide 12
- Woodcock / Glycocalyx?
### Slide 13
- Minerva Anestesiologica 2022 April;88(4):308-13
- DOI: 10.23736/S0375-9393.22.16195-X
### Slide 14
- 10 questions for acute pulmonary edema
- https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-022-06639-8
- Up to 20 fold increase in work of breathing.
- Loop diuretics venodilator; NIV -> Loop diuretic -> vasodil if BP above target
- Strategies for readmission risk reduction:
- Achieve decongestion, treat comorbidities, and initate and restart oral medications

### Slide 15
- doi: 10.3389/fphys.2021.781874
- Interstitial fluid flux: subject to starling forces, Wet-to-Dry index summarizes flux. “Safety factor” formation of interstitial gel.
- Usual ’flux’ Na+ dependent reabsorption
- Note: point B can occur due to increased CO (e.g. marathon running) and is well compensated unless the “safety factor” mechanism is lost
- Inflammation (whether sterile or non-sterile) leads to loss of this mechanism
- Specifically, overdistention, ROS implicated
### Slide 16
- doi: 10.3389/fphys.2021.781874
- Factors protective against edema:
- Initially, fluid accumulates in the thick portion of the interstitium
- In normal conditions, most fluid returns to the capillaries by starling forces, 18% by lymphatics
- In edematous states, lymphatics increase 8-10 fold
- Notably, PEEP will interfere with this process (pushing back toward starting forces)
- Precapillary vasoconstriction -> divert blood flow away from portion of lung with high W/D ratio. This has significant inter-individual variation that may contribute to individuals “prone-ness” to edema formation.
- Importantly – derangements/loss of protective factors can be regional /distention related, and thus “geographic” even when “cardiogenic”
### Slide 17
- doi: 10.3389/fphys.2021.781874
- When does interstitial edema become alveolar edema?
- Vessel -> intstitium transendothelial (PEEP doesn’t help); interstitium -> alveolar transepithelial (PEEP helps, worsened by lung injury)
- Interstitial edema ~5.5 W/D ratio, Alveolar begins to occur ~6 -6.25.
- Alveolar flooding happens fast ~3 minute time constant.
### Slide 18
- CHF and lymphatics
