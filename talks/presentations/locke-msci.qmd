### Slide 13
- Non-invasive ventilation is not the only option
- Obesity and OSA are contributors to many cases
- MDCRC 6200 Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
- All RCTs: Pharmacologic and Surgical Weight Loss
- Expected effect of Tirzepatide: AHI -13.3 events/hr [-8.9 to -17.7]; 44% improvement.
- Decrease of 0.45 (95% CI: 0.18-0.73 events/hour) events per hour for each 1% body weight loss

### Slide 14
- Impact of Doing this Research
- Patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure are not well served by our scientific knowledge base
- Identified cases are at high risk, but often we don’t know what to do
- We unreliably diagnose hypercapnia (even when best management practices known)
- Better identification of patients with hypercapnia will allow:
- Improved care for patients with understood best management
- Improve the rigor of research on multifactorial hypercapnia
- Allow for hypercapnic respiratory failure as a study outcome
- Benchmark current health system performance at diagnosis and treatment
### Slide 15
- Approach to the Solution
- Hypothesis: Health Record Data contains enough information to helpfully stratify patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure.
- Consider:
- Example OSA
- STOP BANG
- Subjective measures:
- Loud snoring, tired/fatigued/sleepy, observed apneas? Report of HTN
- Objective measures:
- BMI, Age, Neck Circumference, Gender
- High-risk increased perioperative complications
### Slide 16
- Pulse Oximeter vs ???? For CO2.
- Hypoxemic (Low O2) Respiratory Failure
- Hypercapnic (High CO2) Respiratory Failure
- Low arterial blood oxygen tension
- High arterial blood carbon dioxide tension
- Definitive diagnosis by Arterial Blood Gas
- Reliably Identified by Pulse Oximetry
- Limited non-invasive testing
- Immediate Life Threat if Severe
- Indicates potentially treatable excess risk
- Applied widely since 1980s with improved recognition
- No systematic Identification
### Slide 17
- Role of HCO3- in Diagnosis of Hypercapnia
- 𝐻2𝑂+𝐶𝑂2 ⇋𝐻2𝐶𝑂3 ⇋ H+ + HCO3-
- Boston Acid-Base “Rules”:
- Acute: ↑ CO2 by 10 mmHg ↑ HCO3- by 1 mEq/L
- Chronic: ↑ CO2 by 10 mmHg ↑ HCO3- by 4 mEq/L
- Thus,
- If CO2 has been ↑ enough, for long enough, and kidneys work well enough: cases of hypercapnia will have ↑ HCO3-
- If there is no other cause of metabolic alkalosis, non-cases will not have ↑ HCO3-
### Slide 18
- Does HCO3- work in other situations?
- Target population: patients whom a clinicians should consider hypercapnia
- Spectrum bias/effect
- Data source: all encounters in TriNetX research network during 2022 who met:
- Predisposing condition: COPD, CHF, Obesity…
- Diagnostic Testing Sent: VBG, ABG
- Related Diagnosis: Other Resp Failure
- Related Management: Vent. Support
- Inpatient, Outpatient, Emergency Visits
- De-identified, patient-level data
- Federated Health Record Data
- 80 US Healthcare Orgs (mostly AMCs)
- Allegedly, Reconciled Inter-institution Linkage
- NOT able to identify institution
### Slide 19
- Add slide with what Wayne did
### Slide 20
- Data Cleaning
- Types of Missing Data:
- For a given encounter, the institution must have submitted some data (any data) for each of the data elements requested.
- Data validation measures:
- Positive controls: if paralytic, expect intubation
- Negative controls: <BMI 30 in OHS
- True (patho)physiologic state
- What the clinician recognizes
- What the clinician documents
- What information is structured
- What data is aggregated in TriNetX
- Problem for our study
- Missing data here is part of what we want to study

### Slide 26
- Additional hypothesis: Potassium levels will improve accuracy.
- Rationale:
- False positives are caused by metabolic alkaloses
- Most metabolic alkaloses cause hypokalemia (diuretics, vomiting, hypovol.)
- Therefore, high bicarbonate with normal/high potassium is more likely a true positive
### Slide 27
- Results:
### Slide 28
- Conclusions
- Serum bicarbonate is potentially diagnostically useful in a variety of previously unvalidated situations
- Some factors correlate with better performance (e.g. Loop diuretic, COPD, CHF, female sex, older age) and others with worse (ER, CKD, Opiate use)
- Loop diuretic performance contradicts prior hypothesis: while they increase false positives, they decrease false negatives more.
- New Finding: Potassium levels and bicarbonate together provide stronger evidence for or against hypercapnia being present.
### Slide 29
- Limitations:
- Partial verification: not everyone gets an arterial blood gas to verify if they have hypercapnia or not.
- Current Finding applies to type of patients who get ABGs
- Probability of obtaining an ABG is variable and idiosyncratic
- Inverse probability of blood-gas weighting? Missing data is tricky
- ‘Acute’, transient hypercapnia will be under-identified.
- Will miss if inadequate time for kidneys to retain HCO3-
- Calendar-day time matching
- Is this a bad thing?
- Is the data quality sufficient?
- Restricted analyses to single-encounter data (cross-sectional)
### Slide 30
- Future: More Predictors Better?
- Traditional clinical test evaluation → bioinformatics
- (priority from easy to understand → works better)
- Approach: Cross-validation
- Bias
- Variance
- Miss the signal (underfitting)
- Fitting the noise(overfitting)
- Too far in either direction worse performance with new data.
### Slide 31
- Approach:
- Same Dataset
- Take structured data elements that are immediately available in HER
- Age, Sex, Serum HCO3- , Serum K+, Serum Creatinine, BMI, Hgb, Venous BG
- Modeling approach: Logistic regression with restricted cubic splines
- Random-forest decision trees: more flexible, less interpretable.
- Output: Predicted (log-odds) of Hypercapnia
### Slide 32
- Preliminary Results
- TBD
### Slide 33
- How can this be put to clinical use?
- Computable Phenotype: algorithms that use more information to label whether a patient has a disease.
- How you decide who ”counts” as having hypercapnic respiratory failure influences the types of patients included..
- Inaccurate disease status classification is a problem for existing EHR-based research
- Use for: Exposure, Covariable Adjustment, Outcomes
### Slide 34
- Probabilistic Modeling Likelihood of Hypercapnia
- Validation & Tuning
- Aim 1: Add Unstructured Data
- Aim 2: Prospective Validation of PPV
- Aim 3: Evaluation of Prognostic Significance
- K23:5-yr
- Refinement and Validation of a method for constructing cohorts of patients with hypercapnia – robust to variable diagnostic performance.
### Slide 35
- Aim 1: Incorporate Unstructured Data
- Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models
- BioBERT: LLM (like ChatGPT) pre-trained on medical text (PubMed/PMC)
- Train to recognize hypercapnia predictors using MIMIC4: 65,000 ICU admissions MGH/BWH
- Nursing triage assessments, Chest XR
- Apply with model to retrospective data from the University of Utah.
- Reference standard: patients who had arterial blood gasses obtained.
- Adjust model weights
- Generate measures of model performance (discrimination and calibration) to inform other aims
- OSA
- Pulmonary Embolism
- STOP BANG
- WELLS Score
- Subjective measures:
- Loud snoring, tired/fatigued/sleepy, observed apneas? Report of HTN
- Objective measures:
- BMI, Age, Neck Circumference, Gender
- Signs/Symptoms of DVT
- PE is most likely
- HR over 100
- Immobilized/Surgery w/n 4 weeks
- Prior PE,
- Hemoptysis
- Malignancy
- High-risk increased perioperative complications
- 0-1 points <1.2% prevalence
- 2-3 points 16.2% prevalence
- 4+ points 37.5% prevalence
- Prior efforts use data points you can’t get from structured fields
- (can only take specific values)
- 1990: Run a big enough prospective study and ask everyone
- 2023: Get ChatGPT to do it from what people document
### Slide 36
- Aim 2: Prospectively Validate: UUH Inpatients
- Deferred consent (CO2 Narcosis)
- Verify Positive Predictive Value (precision) in predicted high-risk patients with Transcutaneous CO2
- Smaller sample stratified sampling of the whole population.
- Prioritizes proof of concept, rather than delineate scope of the problem (initially)
- Sample Size Calculation: stata diagsampsi
- Rate of presentation to hospital: (TriNetX)
- % Predicted High Risk: (10%)
- % of eligible enrolled
- 25% ‘prevalence’ (Nowbar); model AUC; Se/Sp TcCO2 for true reference standard 85%/85%
### Slide 37
- Prior work:
- …
- 49: Correct 93%, Wrong 7%: weight: 1.98%
- 48: Correct 88%, Wrong 12%: weight: 2.39%
- 47: Correct 80%, Wrong 20%: weight: 2.47%
- 46: Correct 69%, Wrong 31%: weight: 2.92%
- 45: Correct 57%, Wrong 43%: weight: 3.11%
- SENSITIVITY
- SPECIFICITY
- 44: Correct 57%, Wrong 43% 3.56%
- 43: Correct 69%, Wrong 31% weight 3.73
- 42: Correct 80%, Wrong 20% weight 4.16%
- 41: Correct 88%, Wrong 12% weight 4.25%
- 40: Correct 93%, Wrong 7% weight 4.58%
- ….
- Expected test characteristics:
- sensitivity 89%
- specificity 92%
- if
- agreement ~6 mmHg
- same distribution of CO2
- Tool
- Health Record-Based Modeling
- Transcutaneous CO2
- Purpose
- Refine Estimation of Pre-test Odds of Hypercapnia
- Allow non-invasive CO2 assessment (patients unlikely to consent for research ABGs)
- Limitation
- Approach only externally validated in outpatient OHS assessment
- Prior 95% agreement +/- 6 mmHg insufficient for unstratified clinical use
### Slide 38
- Aim 3: Estimate the potential impact
- Overdiagnosis: people who meet the definition of disease, but do not benefit from it
- PaCO2 is an imperfect reference standard for what we care about: future harm
- Possible – though not likely – clinicians already identify the important cases
- Need a ‘loyalty cohort’: patients whose rehospitalizations would be captured.
- Veterans Affairs – or artificially constructed one from another data source.
- Hypothesis: Patients predicted to have had hypercapnia that was not recognized have a similar or excess risk of subsequent readmission as those identified (by blood gas and/or ICD code)
- Prior efforts use data points you can’t get from structured fields
- (can only take specific values)
### Slide 39
- OVERALL: Patients with Consequentially Missed Hypercapnia can be Identified Using Health Record Elements
- OVERALL: There is a significant burden of unrecognized hypercapnia among hospitalized patients.
- 3 aims
- Aim 1: Model Refinement and Local Optimization
- Aim 2: Prospective Validation
- Aim 3: Assess Potential Impact
- Hypothesis
- Fine-tuning and refining previously derived model will improve local performance
- Patients with hypercapnia that are not recognized are common can be identified using health record elements with high positive-predictive value.
- Inpatients who were predicted, but not confirmed, to have hypercapnic respiratory failure are at high risk of adverse outcomes.
- Rationale
- The model should be optimized for local performance
- Must be verified that model identifies unrecognized hypercapnia
- Need to confirm that the identified patients face elevated risk (ABG PaCO2 is an imperfect reference standard).
- Approach
- Optimizing model performance +/- use of NLP tools) applied to U of U data
- Non-invasively sample (with TcCO2) patients predicted to have hypercapnia that teams have not recognized
- Among patients with an admission for hypercapnia that is identified, how many had preceding admissions likely to have hypercapnia?
- Design
- Retrospective, U of U
- Prospective, U of U
- Retrospective, VA
- Payoff: This work will evaluate the potential for improved recognition of hypercapnia to help a particularly high-risk, enlarging, and understudied group of patients.
- Career Development: Prospective validations of bioinformatic tools require a unique skillset
### Slide 40
- Summary
- Considering hypercapnic respiratory failure as a syndrome offers insight into its attributable health burden
- Current diagnosis is haphazard and suboptimal
- This introduces problems for patient care and reliable research.
- Better use of health record data can help address both problems.
- Preliminary work has led to new clinical features, but more sophisiticated modeling is needed for impact.
- Related Questions
- Methods of handling of partial verification
- Regression-based vs Random Forest (or other ML)
- Clinical and modeling Incorporation of Venous BG
- Socio-technical barriers to diagnosis
- Longitudinal Cohort Creation
- Is UT atypical? (elevation)
- Sources of provider/unit/institution variation?
