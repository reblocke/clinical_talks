Codex Implementation Ticket: Port intro_clin_research Quarto-book scaffold to clinical_talks and retitle to “Clinical Talks”

Summary

Create a Quarto book scaffold in clinical_talks by porting the existing Quarto structure (config, folders, styling, conventions) from intro_clin_research, while replacing the chapter list so that each page corresponds to a clinical talk topic. Populate each talk page as a stub (template + TODO sections). Use the archive/ folder in clinical_talks as the source-of-truth to infer talk topics and link to source materials.

This ticket is structure-only; substantive content migration/writing will happen in a later prompt.

The source repo currently contains a Quarto book project with multiple .qmd chapters and supporting folders like _extensions/, include/, images/, docs/, and _freeze/.  ￼
The target repo currently has only minimal files (e.g., .gitattributes, LICENSE, README.md).  ￼

Goals
	•	Retitle the project to “Clinical Talks” everywhere it matters (Quarto config, site title, README).
	•	Port the structural scaffold from intro_clin_research to clinical_talks:
	•	Quarto book wiring (_quarto.yml, chapter organization, includes/extensions, styling assets).
	•	Consistent conventions for images, includes, references, and rendering output.
	•	Replace “chapters” with “talk topic pages”:
	•	Create one .qmd per talk topic.
	•	Minimal stub content (section headers + TODOs).
	•	Use archive/ in clinical_talks to drive page creation:
	•	Each talk page should link to its corresponding source material(s) under archive/.
	•	Enable GitHub Pages publishing in a simple, reproducible way (see “Publishing approach” below).

⸻

Non-goals
	•	Writing full clinical content.
	•	Converting slides into prose.
	•	Curating citations/references beyond placeholders.
	•	Reorganizing/rewriting the archive/ content (except possibly to create a stable, talk-per-folder structure if it’s currently messy).

⸻

Publishing approach

Use Quarto’s simplest GitHub Pages approach: render to docs/ and commit docs/ (plus add .nojekyll). This is explicitly supported by Quarto’s documentation.  ￼

Note: If you prefer a cleaner git history (no rendered output committed), we can switch later to the “publish to gh-pages branch via GitHub Actions” approach. Quarto provides an official workflow for that.  ￼

⸻

Implementation Plan (Codex Runbook)

0) Branching and safety
	•	In clinical_talks, create a feature branch:
	•	codex/port-quarto-scaffold
	•	Do not modify intro_clin_research except to read/copy from it.
	•	Ensure no PHI/PII exists in clinical_talks/archive/ before publishing anything (quick scan; do not attempt “clever” detection—just flag obvious risks).

⸻

1) Copy the Quarto scaffold (structure, not content)

From intro_clin_research → clinical_talks, copy the structural pieces required to build/render a Quarto book, including (as applicable):

Copy / recreate (preferred)
	•	_quarto.yml (then edit heavily—see next section)
	•	_extensions/ (the source repo uses Quarto extensions, e.g., quarto-ext/fontawesome).  ￼
	•	include/ (custom includes, partials, CSL, etc., if present).  ￼
	•	images/ (or at minimum any shared branding/cover assets).  ￼
	•	references.qmd (keep as an appendix placeholder)  ￼
	•	README.md (rewrite for clinical_talks)
	•	.gitignore (merge intelligently with existing)
	•	Optional (keep only if you want RStudio ergonomics consistent with the source):
	•	clinical_talks.Rproj (create new, do not keep the old name)
	•	.Rprofile, .Rbuildignore only if still relevant to the workflow

Do NOT copy
	•	docs/ from the source repo (it is rendered output; we will render fresh in the target)
	•	_freeze/ from the source repo (render fresh; only commit after first render if using freeze)
	•	Any OS/editor artifacts:
	•	.DS_Store, .Rhistory, etc. (these appear in the source repo but should not be ported as “best practice”).  ￼

⸻

2) Rebuild _quarto.yml for “Clinical Talks”

Edit the copied _quarto.yml so it is correct for clinical_talks:
	•	Set book/project metadata:
	•	Title: Clinical Talks
	•	Repo URL: reblocke/clinical_talks
	•	Site URL: expected to be https://reblocke.github.io/clinical_talks/ (standard GH Pages convention)
	•	Configure output directory for GitHub Pages:
	•	project: output-dir: docs (Quarto “Render to docs” method).  ￼
	•	Add .nojekyll at repo root.  ￼
	•	Add freeze to support reproducible rendering without CI execution (recommended even if you don’t have much code):
	•	execute: freeze: auto (Quarto recommends checking _freeze/ into version control when used).  ￼
	•	Replace the chapter list with talk topic pages:
	•	Remove research-focused chapters (e.g., project selection, stats foundations, regression, etc.) and replace with talk .qmds.

Expected source chapters (for reference only): the source book includes items like “How to Select a Project”, “Statistical Software”, “Data”, “Basics of Study Design”, etc.  ￼
Target chapters: index.qmd + talk topic pages + (optional) appendices like references.qmd.

⸻

3) Create a talk-page layout and generate stub pages from archive/

Create a stable structure to support “one page per topic area.”

Directory convention
	•	Create talks/ directory in the repo root:
	•	talks/ holds Quarto pages (.qmd) only
	•	archive/ holds raw source materials (slides, notes, PDFs, etc.)

Talk discovery rule (must be deterministic)
	•	If archive/ contains top-level folders: treat each folder as one talk topic.
	•	Else (flat archive): treat each file as a candidate talk if it matches:
	•	*.pptx, *.pdf, *.md, *.qmd, *.docx (adjust as needed)
	•	Ignore hidden/system files.

For each discovered talk topic
	•	Create a slugified filename: talks/<slug>.qmd
	•	Create a stub page with:
	•	YAML front matter: title, optionally subtitle, and set draft: true (so it’s visually “in progress”)
	•	Standard talk outline headings, e.g.:
	•	Clinical question / why this matters
	•	Key points
	•	Approach / algorithm
	•	Evidence / guidelines (TODO)
	•	Pitfalls / pearls
	•	References (TODO)
	•	A “Source materials” section linking to the relevant archive/... files.

Add pages to the book ToC
	•	Add all generated talks/*.qmd into _quarto.yml book: chapters: in a stable order:
	•	Alphabetical by slug, or
	•	If archive folders have dates, sort by date.

⸻

4) Create index.qmd tailored to “Clinical Talks”
	•	Replace the intro_clin_research “Overview” content with a minimal landing page:
	•	What this is (a book of clinical talks)
	•	Intended audience (residents, etc.)
	•	How to use (read before rounds; quick reference)
	•	Disclaimer (educational; not medical advice)
	•	A short “How this site is organized” section pointing to the talk pages

(Keep the content brief; placeholders are fine.)

⸻

5) References appendix (placeholder)
	•	Keep references.qmd (appendix) but rewrite it to match the new project:
	•	Explain how references will be managed (eventually via bibliography: in front matter + .bib)
	•	If the source project uses a references.bib or CSL in include/, copy it; otherwise create a placeholder references.bib with 1–2 dummy entries.

⸻

6) Update README.md for target repo

Rewrite README.md so it is accurate for clinical_talks:
	•	Project description: “Clinical Talks”
	•	Local preview:
	•	quarto preview
	•	Render for publishing:
	•	quarto render (HTML)
	•	GitHub Pages note:
	•	“This repo publishes from docs/ on main”
	•	Contribution/editing notes (optional)

⸻

7) Rendering and verification
	•	Run locally from repo root:
	•	quarto render (or quarto render --to html if the config includes PDF/EPUB and you want to avoid TeX)
	•	Verify:
	•	docs/index.html exists
	•	Site title shows “Clinical Talks”
	•	Sidebar/ToC lists talk pages
	•	Each talk page loads and links to archive artifacts correctly
	•	Commit rendered output:
	•	git add docs .nojekyll _freeze (if freeze produces _freeze/)
	•	git commit -m "Scaffold Quarto book for Clinical Talks"

Quarto explicitly documents output-dir: docs, committing docs/, and adding .nojekyll for GitHub Pages.  ￼

⸻

Acceptance Criteria
	•	clinical_talks contains a functional Quarto book scaffold analogous to intro_clin_research’s structure (extensions/includes/images conventions are carried over).  ￼
	•	_quarto.yml title is Clinical Talks and chapter list is talk-topic pages, not research-training chapters.
	•	talks/ directory exists with at least one stub talk page (or one per archive item discovered).
	•	quarto render succeeds and produces a navigable HTML site under docs/.
	•	.nojekyll exists at repo root.  ￼
	•	README describes how to preview/render and how publishing works.
	•	No OS/editor junk files are added (e.g., .DS_Store, .Rhistory).

⸻

Deliverables (in PR)
	•	Structural port + rewritten config + talk stubs + working render output:
	•	_quarto.yml
	•	index.qmd
	•	talks/*.qmd (generated stubs)
	•	references.qmd (+ optional references.bib)
	•	_extensions/, include/, images/ as needed
	•	.nojekyll
	•	docs/ (rendered output)
	•	Updated README.md
	•	Updated .gitignore

⸻

Notes for Codex
	•	Prefer small, logically separated commits:
	1.	copy scaffold
	2.	rewrite _quarto.yml + retitle
	3.	generate talk stubs from archive/
	4.	render + publish output (docs/, _freeze/)
	5.	README cleanup
	•	Do not attempt to “fill in” medical content—leave TODO markers.
	•	If clinical_talks/archive/ is not present in the checked-out repo, create it (empty) and still generate 1–2 placeholder talk pages so the ToC is not empty.
