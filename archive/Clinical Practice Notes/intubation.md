- prepare the patient: assess for indicators of difficult airway, reliable IV/IO access, optimize position (wedge if obese), find cricothyroid membrane, optimise hemodynamics e.g. [for shock](###considerations-in-shock), consider C-spine protection

- prepare the equipment: [drugs](###Drugs), [equipment](##Equipment)  

- prepare people: allocate the roles of 1st intubator, 2nd intubator, who to apply cricoid force, who to pass ETT tube, who to push drugs, who to monitor the patient, who will scribe/track time, who will perform FONA if needed. Who we call for help. Consider location around the patient. 

- Verbalize the plan: "Airway plan is": Plan A (Drugs and Laryngoscopy), Plan B and C (second incubator after 3 attempts, superglottic vs facemask), Plan D (FONA/Scalpel-bougie-tube)

- preoxygenation
- pretreatment (e.g. fentanyl if needed)
- paralysis and induction
- placement with proof [steps](##steps), confirmation with ETCO2
- postintubation management

##Steps: 
- Look in mouth (insert glidescope midline), 
- look at screen (insert past uvula to epiglotis, then forward), 
- look in mouth (while inserting ETT from corner of mouth and rotating midline), 
- then look at screen (to insert through vocal folds, retract style with thumb before passing into the airway). 

## Equipement: 

Glidescope vs DL 

Glidescope - blade has more angulation than Mac blade (easier view, harder to pass ETT). Only need grade 2 view (grade 1 = will often cause too much distortion. 
- can now use Mac blade glidescope either for DL (with attending seeing VL). Placed into velecula so that epiglottis is visualized. 
- Mac (curved) vs Miller (straight) - Miller goes straight past epiglottis and hooks it out of the way -> straight view through cords.

- working suction (Yankauer suction tip = stiff, large intake)
- ETT tube with cuff checked (x2) and attached syringe
- Bougie
- Stylet
- Supraglottic airway
- OPA/NPA
- BVM with PEEP valve
- Front of neck access set (blade, bougie)
- ETCO2 monitor

Rigid Stylet = for hyper-angulated blade.
Malleable Style = for DL 
[ ] Mac blade VL? 

Sniff position for both DL and VL 

## Rapid Sequence Induction

Definition: unresponsiveness (induction agent) and neuromuscular relaxation simultaneously. Traditionally - this meant no ventilation.

Use: minimize risk of aspiration, need for immediate control.

## Modified RSI
same as above, except with pre-oxygenation (often with OPA and BVM to maximized FRC. Although BiPAP or HFNC can work) ahead of time. This is the most common current approach. 

## Delayed Sequence Intubation

Use: RSI leads to significant hypoxemia because they can't be pre-oxygenated or need to do something (e.g. insert NG tube) that they won't tolerate prior. 

e.g. someone who is too agitated to be effectively ventilated.

Worry: will increase risk of aspiration

- head up
- induction agent but with the intent of keeping them ventilating (e.g. ketamine 1-2mg/kg. though Dr. Bott suggests a lower dose to avoid making them go apneic - e.g. 20mg ketamine)
- pre-oxygenated (as above)
- administer neuromuscular blocks (e.g. rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg IV)
- intubate

### Pre-oxygenation

Use: Extend safe-apnea time (SaO2 > 88%) by flushing nitrogen out of the lungs (so SaO2 = 100% does NOT mean adequately pre-oxygenated) . In OR can assess ETO2 to ensure preoxygenated. ~8 minutes in health who is preox (vs 1 minute without), less if ill. 

- head up, wedge if obese
- place NC at 6 to 15L (for some apneic oxygenation), leave HFNC in place if already on (has been shown to increase nonhypoxic apneic time in obese patients).
- use BVM at w/ 15 L/min O2 for 3m+, or face mask

### Oxygenation 

- if someone is large / may be hard to ventilate, but already desaturating... consider putting in an LMA to be able apply more PEEP to recruit (can also blind intubate thru LMA with 90% success rate - higher in obese patients. Use bronchoscope if still worried and intubating through LMA)

- often after intubation - weigh risk of high peep / recruitment with dropping venous return / increasing RV afterload.

### Ways to avoid aspiration / Peri-intubation risk

Prevention (still a risk with all intubations, even when NPO because gastric emptying is variable. Can use US to assess)
- keep some height to the head of the bed
- wait the full 55-60 seconds for paralysis to insert blade (no gagging)
- insert an OPA or NPA before doing any bagging - with gentle pressure.
- if using cricoid pressure - pressure must be on the cricoid ring itself (not larynx or trachea - those aren't circumferential).
- NG tube before? doesn't fully empty the stomach so no risk reduction unless there is a compressed stomach (e.g. SBO, gastroparesis and distention) in which case it may be ok if they can protect their airway if they vomit while inserting.

####Access
- Peripheral usually OK
- IO is an option, however the infusion can be quite painful. Consider use of adjunctive lidocaine though the I/O first to avoid this. 
- is there time to put in a central line first to ensure access?

Upmost importance to have reliable access. Make sure meds going through the line that is flushing/drawing easiest.

## Drugs

pretreatment, induction, paralytic. Summary
- fentanyl 2-3 mcg/kg IV (sympathomimetic, neuro/vascular protection for MI/Stroke/Dissection)
- induction agents - sedative/hypnotics (ketamine 1.5-2 mg/kg IBW = dissociative, Etomidate (0.3-0.4 mg/kg TBW, fent 2-10 mcg/kg TBW, propofol 1.5-2.5 mg/kg TBW)
- defasciculating dose of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker (0.1-0.12 mg/kg rocuronium or 0.01 mg/kg vecuronium) - can be reversed by sugamedex if needed

####Sedative/hypnotics
Indication: 
- use to provide comfort
- prevent HTN/tachycardia
- prevent intracranial HTN (from pain/glottic stim)

##### Ketamine
- 1.5 mg/kg. Rapid onset/short duration of effect. 
- Dose dependent negative inotropy (patient may counteract with endogenous catecholamines - though in extremis they are often catacholamine depletion)
- may or may not increase ICP, but does increase cerebral metabolism

##### Etomidate
- 0.3 mg/kg
- rapid onset, short duration of effect
- minimal, if any, dose-dependent hemodynamic effect. Reduces ICP and CMRO2.
- Adrenal suppression with single dose? Not sure. Definitely happens if you use it as a gtt for sedation (which is why this is not done) 

##### Midazolam
- previously used more. Dose 0.15 mg/kg (10mg). Longer action
- moderate dose-dependent hemodynamic effect. Reduces ICP and cerebral metabolic rate

##### Propofol 
- 2 mg/kg (150mg). Rapid onset and very short duration of effect (gone in 10 minutes). 
- anti-emetic and bronchodilator, reduces ICP and cerebral metabolism.
- profound hemodynamic effects: hypovolemia or heart failure

## Paralytics / Neuromuscular blockers

Paralyze voluntary muscle (not cardiac or smooth muscle), including vocal cords and diaphragm. 

History: in old days, used to avoid paralytics because it was thought that by avoiding respiratory arrest, failure to pass ETT would not be as big of a problem. However, this did not pan out because it also makes it much harder to bag. 

Indication: Use always unless they have no brain stem function.

- prevent active vomiting (though not passive regurgitation) and laryngospasm. 
- to facilitate BVM or laryngoscopy.

#####Rocuronium
Dose: 1.2 mg/kg
Onset: 50 seconds, Duration: 45-60 minute duration of effect (need to cover this long tail - ICP goes through the roof)
No CV/ICP effects, no contraindications.

#####Succinylcholine
Onset: 50 seconds, duration: 8-10. 
Dose: 1.5 mg/kg but dose-response curve is wide. 
No CV effect or insignificant ICP effect. Malig. Hyperthermia risk, raises K by 0.5-1 mEq for 10 minutes (as cells repolarize), thus don't use if K < 5.0 or chronic denervation injury (e.g. hemi/para/quadriplegia - more ACh receptors), large burn, rhabdo.

##Adjuncts
Lidocaine - anesthesia does always. Avoids burn of infusion, and has some general anesthetic effect. 100mg dose right before you push the sedative hypnotic.

Fentanyl - anesthesia does always. 100 mcg. Be aware that dose-response is widely variable and this can cause apnea in folks who are sensitivity.

Dexmedetomidine - adjunct for awake intubation or to facilitate pre-oxygenation in AMS. 10-20 mg IVP

## Peri-intubation arrest
Incidence 2-5% 
Usually PEA
Usually <6 minutes after intubation
50% mortality

Risk factors: High BMI, SaO2 <92% despite pre-oxygenation (desat->arrest time is short), SBP <90 or Shock index > 0.9, failure to use pre-intubation checklist.

## Difficult Airway

- consider awake intubation with ketamine, video-assisted laryngoscopy (glidescope)
- After 3 attempts at DL/ VL: declare this a failed airway.
- supraglottic (king or LMA) airway recommended in intubation fails while next steps arranged. 
- +1 attempt at DL/VL by more experience operator, consider maximum 2 attempts intubating through a different method. 
- if can't oxygenate and can't ventilate at any point: Declare CICO and procede to scalpel cricothyroidotomy (front of neck access)

#### Scalpel cricothyroidotomy

Put in an LMA

- find (or have previously marked) the cricothyroid
- insert 10 blade scalpel with dominant hand, blade toward operator.
- rotate blade 90 degrees and pull toward operator
- insert bougie on far side of blade and in to trachea
- insert ETT over the top of the blade
- if obese and cricothyroid cartilage is not identifiable, perform a vertical skin incision followed by manual dissection of tissue is required.

####How to predict the difficult airway

Source: doi:10.1001/jama.2018.21413

#####History
- history of difficult intubation
- snoring (+LR 3.4, -LR 0.65)

#####Exam
- poor mandibular range via Upper Lip Bite test (inability to bite any part of lip = +LR 14, ability to bite vermillion border = -LR 0.42)
- cervical spine mobility via sternomental distance (impaired = +LR 4.2, -LR 0.77)
- interincisor gap (mouth opening capacity. +LR 3.6, -LR 0.71) - difficult to assess mallampati in ICU because patients need to be able to take the sniffing position and open their mouth without saying ahh.

##Specific Cases

### Considerations in Shock

Loss of negative pressure ventilation is main driver (not medication) in most hypovolemic folks. Also, loss of catecholamine tone. 

- use titrated dose of induction agent to avoid hemodynamic compromise - 1/2 dose in elderly or patients with AMS. (also, perhaps smaller Vd in shock)
- ketamine is least cardio-depressing
- avoid apnea worsening acidosis
- resuscitate before you intubate (decrease preload switching to positive pressure ventilation)
- consider no sedative hypnotic for patients in extremis

### Cervical injury

-anterior C collar off (need to access neck and open mouth)
-someone holding in-line stabilization (not traction) to not allow movement
-use Glidescope (bronchoscope and LMA as backup) 

### Severe PAH
-quick (avoid prolonged hypoventilation - increase vasoconstriction in lung)
-use systemic vasoconstrictors and inotrope infusion (since they will lose tone - e.g. NE for MAP 75-80 to allow adequate coronary perfusion pressure and 0.3 milrinone for 10 minutes)
-Admin Flolan 8ml/hr = max via mask to reduce PVR as much as you can
-smaller dose of sedative hypnotic and full dose roc. you need some baseline catacholamine/inotropic tone so avoid high dose sedative.
