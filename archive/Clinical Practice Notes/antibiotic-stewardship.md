# Antibiotic Stewardship

Do not renally adjust first dose of antibiotics (pharmacokinetics of first dose: concentration in blood is a result of volume of distribution. Elimination is only impactful on subsequent doses). 

Spiraling empiricism: 

Disease severity is not correlated with resistant organisms. Rationale for broad initial coverage assumes that more severe illness is not at higher risk of adverse effects.
